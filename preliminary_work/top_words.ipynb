      "('Bainbridge Street Barrel House', '\\nwe decided to give the barrel house another shot as we live in the neighborhood. we took our friends and their young daughter. service was very slow and we never got all of our drinks. the food took forever to come out. when we asked for our check they said their systems were down and that was causing the delay- not sure why they couldn\\'t have offered this information earlier. to top it all off, our entire party got very sick after dinner (and no one ate the same thing). needless to say, we\\'ll never go back.\\na quick gander at my face as i was ogling the nachos we ordered and my dining buddies chuckled and said \"can\\'t wait to see how you rate this spot...\" hmm, i don\\'t know if that says more about me or about bainbridge... but there you have it. i\\'ve been once or twice before for beer events and truly have never been impressed. they tend to get the internet super hype for something like a sour tap takeover and then, when i arrive, there\\'s about four rows of people, not enough staff, not enough room, and an unclear tap list. i normally stick around for about a single beer, and then call it a night (this has happened twice).\\n\\nthis visit, i figured \"hey, why not try some of the eats?\"so three of us head over for dinner. my two girlfriends got a drink, nothing fancy but they enjoyed. we split an order of nachos, two of us got chili, and the other sweet potato gnocchi. the service was pretty fast on the nacho front though, in the meantime, the music was so loud that we could hardly hear each other talk. surprising for a tuesday night around 8pm. it wasn\\'t terribly crowded, which made that volume situation even worse.\\n\\nthe nachos arrived and were loaded with guac on top, initially exciting. alas, once the guac was pushed around, we noticed a fairly uneven distribution of toppings (one of my pet peeves in the hunt for philly\\'s best nacho). they were also not terribly warm.... it was a shame. our server kind of bailed for a little after that, but the volume was still too loud for conversation. he eventually made it back with our chili and gnocchi. the chili was delicious and meaty, hearty serving for $6. the gnocchi wasn\\'t too bad either, could\\'ve used some more sauce but the texture was on point. \\n\\ni think our biggest feeling was \"it was definitely a-ok.\" alas, in a city full of amazing eats and drinks, a-ok isn\\'t going to bring me back in a hurry. i\\'ve heard the fried pickles are insane so, if/when i do make it back, that\\'ll be my first choice.\\nupdate for happy hour:\\n\\nif you like craft beer - you have got to come to happy hour here. the entire draft list minus the hand pump (which is like 20 beers) - is half off from 4:30-6:30. yes, it\\'s on the early side, but it\\'s an awesome way to try those $8 beers that you might not order otherwise. (there\\'s $5 wine too).\\ni have been here twice, and i had good experiences both times.\\n\\non a monday, some friends and i ended up here. it took our server a little too long to take our order, but that\\'s okay. we ordered some fries for the table that were delicious. portions weren\\'t huge, but i didn\\'t think that was a big problem. it took our food awhile to arrive, but everyone was happy when they started eating. i ordered the soup of the day - celeriac which was very good. i also got the 4 cheese mac, which i loved. it was nice and creamy with pieces of pretzels and goldfish on top that i thought was a nice touch. friends at the table got the meatballs, cod sandwich (and the size of the fish was not tiny as a previous reviewer mentioned), one of the salads, and the burger. everyone liked their food, and the service was good. \\n\\nwent again on a sunday about 12:30 for brunch. portions here are not sabrinas, but honestly, every time i go to sabrinas i leave feeling disgustingly full, so i\\'m okay with this not being that. i ordered an omelet with brie, onion, and sausage that came with fries and some apple for $11.50. (regular omelets are $10 but this was a build your own variety.) the omelet was very tasty, with plenty of brie and big chunks of sausage. friends ordered the scrapple biscuit sandwich, lamb and poached egg over sweet potatoes (which was on the smaller side but looked great), and another omelet with salmon and cream cheese. again, everyone was happy. they only charge $1.50 for coffee, and i had several cups. i also ordered a bloody mary, which was really good! \\n\\ni like this place. i wasn\\'t blown away by it, but i think the food is solid and the drinks are good. the wait staff and manager, in my experiences, have been great. not everything was perfect, but i enjoyed this place and will be back.\\ni ventured here on opening night with a party of 5 [others]... extremely excited of the prospect of this new, awesome-looking place in one of my favorite neighborhoods.  i ran past a few times while it was under construction and was more than excited for it to open up.\\n\\ni probably should have had the foresight to know that opening night + cool neighborhood + awesome menu = overcrowded and chaotic.  alas, my foresight hat was nowhere to be found that night.  one of the guys in our party put our name in for a table and the hostess told him it would be 45 minute to an hour.\\n\\nwe were all willing to wait at the bar with their extensive list of beers and fancy cocktails, and so we ordered a few snacks.  the fried pickles were tasty, as were the fries with the barrel house wiz, scallions, yada yada.  but we were truly looking forward to a full meal... so we waited.\\n\\nand waited.  and waited.  by the time we collectively decided to leave, almost two and a half hours had gone by since we had put our name in.  we were frustrated, mostly out of disappointment and hunger, but not overly disgruntled... yet.  one of the fellas in our party approached the manager to let him know that we had waited for a long, long time and that we were leaving, and this particular manager basically said that he was sick and tired of hearing complaints.  \\n\\nwe were totally planning on coming back on a quieter night, until the little run in with the manager.  such a shame.\\nbarrel house is a quality place, rounding out an awesome corner of the area (l\\'etage, beaumonde ...). i love the atmosphere, the enthusiastically friendly staff, and of course, that construction on that corner is finally finished!\\n\\ni\\'ve been to barrel house a couple times -- once for their opening, where i had a great cocktail (+10 points) and a pretty good quinoa salad (sample that they brought out when we said we\\'re vegan!) (+2).\\n\\nwhen i found out they were open for breakfast, i had to come try it out. it\\'s exceedingly reasonable for the area ($6 for many plates, compared to $8-$12 at nearby sabrina\\'s) (+5) and they make pots of tea. breakfast places that get tea ... (+20).\\n\\nwhile the menu for dinner has limited vegetarian/vegan options, i\\'m looking forward to trying it out, and definitely further enjoying their cocktail menu.\\na friend and i swung by bsbh for a drink last week. we arrived during happy hour and requested outside seating from the friendly host. draft beers were discounted for the happy hour special so we each ordered a brew. our server asked if we\\'d like water and though we said yes, we never actually received it. no big as we were only there for one drink. \\n\\nwe also ordered the fried pickles which were okay, but didn\\'t have much flavor. they tasted more like fried cucumbers than fried pickles; the briny taste of a pickle was not really detectable. \\n\\nbased on this experience i\\'m going with three stars but i definitely want to get back at some point to experience more.\\ni\\'ve given this place three shots; unfortunately, something is just not clicking for me with bainbridge street barrel house. the most recent experience was specifically for old school video game night. friends had told me that wednesdays are the night for this so a group of us went over. the phillies game was on so the bartender said he would hook up the system after the game. we arrived during the sixth inning so we were there for a while. we waited about ten minutes or so post-game but the bartender was pretty busy so a few of us decided to call it a night. if the policy is that game night only happens if there isn\\'t a game on, that\\'s fine. but i\\'d rather know up front so i can decide for myself whether to stick around. \\n\\nsaid bartender was responsible for the patrons at the bar plus the people sitting at the high top tables nearby. our large group had to order drinks from the bar as there was only one server available and he was handling the rest of the restaurant and the tables outside. i wasn\\'t in the mood for beer so i ordered the house gin infused with cucumber, with a little bit of st. germain and some seltzer. the drink was flat. a friend said she\\'d had similar experiences with the club tasting flat at bsbh. \\n\\ndespite the revolving door, it was still very hot inside. the server used the side door which definitely let some hot and humid air inside, but this could have been overcome with a little increased ac. it was uncomfortable. \\n\\non my second visit i did enjoy a burger. it was earlier in the evening and there were more servers around. i wouldn\\'t be opposed to grabbing a bite or happy hour drink at some point, but i won\\'t go out of my way, either.\\n3.5 stars. unfortunately our first experience at barrel house didn\\'t live up to what we were expecting and what others have experienced. i\\'m going to give them the benefit of the doubt a tad because our visit was the same day as south street spring festival as well as the kentucky derby so things may have been a bit different than they would have on any other given day. maybe. \\n\\nwe were seated fairly quickly, but things went downhill from there. it was 20 minutes before dinner time and they would absolutely not let us order from the dinner menu. the lunch menu did not offer some items our group was interested in. we ordered drinks (crafts brews-pretty decent selection) and just killed some time, trying not to roll our eyes at the waiter. some of our party wanted to leave right then and there. we were really hungry and tired. i get it, 20 minutes isn\\'t that long. that was exactly my point to them also. we were a party of 8 and were obviously going to spend a bit of money, was it that big a deal to upset us? it was a turn off, but we were all so tired from a full day of fun at the festival we just sat. then we had two different guys very slowly bringing us our food. we had no idea which one was our waiter. one took drink order, then the next guy came to take drink orders, again. then one guy took our meal orders. then the other guy brought the orders. then we couldn\\'t find either one when we were ready for the bill. the entire meal including time waiting before and waiting after we ate took way too long!! \\n\\nhere\\'s what the table had and what they had to say:\\n\\n-roast pork 2 1/2. \"sarcone\\'s rolls should never be toasted. may as well have been amorosos\" \\n\\n-mussels 1 \"bland\"\\n\\n-mac and cheese 3 \"just ok\"\\n\\n-veggie sammy 2 1/2 \\n\"just alright had a funny taste\"\\n\\n-fish and chips 4 \"says it came with vinegar, but when we asked they said they don\\'t have malt vinegar in house at all! why would you serve fish & chip and not have vinegar?\" \\n\\n-tots \"delicious!!\" 5 \\n\\n-brussels \"very, very good\" 5 \\n\\n-mezze platter 4 not much to complain about. it was plated beautifully and it was tasty! they obliged when i asked for double hummus instead of goat cheese. \\n\\n-burger 3.5 good enough. \"too well done for medium rare\" \\n\\n\"too noisy. slow service.\" \"horrible\" was a word from our table used to describe the service. \\n\\nthe place is cool. it has neat light fixtures, high tops, bar seating as well as outdoor seating and those great big windows that open up allowing for a nice breeze. they had the derby on and the entire place was lively with a nice crowd of people.\\n\\n i personally may give it another go, i\\'m not sure the others would. perhaps for brunch next time...\\n3.5 stars. unfortunately our first experience at barrel house didn\\'t live up to what we were expecting and what others have experienced. i\\'m going to give them the benefit of the doubt a tad because our visit was the same day as south street spring festival as well as the kentucky derby so things may have been a bit different than would would on any other given day. maybe. \\n\\nwe were seated fairly quickly, but things went downhill from there. it was 20 minutes before dinner time and they would absolutely not let us order from the dinner menu. the lunch menu did not offer some items our group was interested in. we ordered drinks (crafts brews-pretty decent selection) and just killed some time, trying not to roll our eyes at the waiter. some of our party wanted to leave right then and there. we were really hungry and tired. i get it, 20 minutes isn\\'t that long. that was exactly my point to them also. we were a party of 8 and were obviously going to spend a bit of money, was it that big a deal to upset us?

(yeah, i\\'m not making any friends on that comment huh?)\\nwell i stand by that statement. the fries i had here were so crispy, golden, and seasoned perfectly. maybe you just waited too long to eat them. i asked for some hot sauce (because i\\'m that person..).and the house made hot sauce i tried was amazing. i was so floored by how the flavor profile built with the heat. if you like hot sauces definitely try this one. you\\'ll want to take some home. \\n\\nnext i can speak to the deliciousness of the pickled butternut squash. so.damn.good.\\ni want to eat them every day. \\n\\nperhaps a restaurant that has barely been open a month could be given a few more chances to wow you. perfecting a staff and getting your groove together takes time. \\nharsh critics always seem to be the people with the least understanding of the industry. it\\'s important to support local business and this is a solid go-to in the making for sure.\\na classier tgi friday\\'s with better service and nicer font.\\n\\nwhat i liked:\\nburger meat was actual meat versus a puck and correctly cooked to order -- medium rare, which is hard to come by. the burger was not delicious by any definition, but at least it was real.\\n\\nfries originally came out room temp, i sent them back and they whisked them away without complaint. new batch was fine.\\n\\nservice was very friendly and prompt.\\n\\n\\nwhat i didn\\'t like:\\nbartender gave a cheap pour. at least compared to other places in the city. when it\\'s a $14 bourbon, i notice.\\n\\nbacon i requested was blech. when i say bacon on a burger, what do you visualize? strips? yes. bacon crumble? no. of course you don\\'t. and neither did i. \\n\\nburger has no tomato (unless that\\'s an option). this bugs me.\\n\\nside salad was drenched in two creamy cups of salad dressing and a bucket of salt. 75% less dressing, please.\\n\\ntable by the window (6th street side) sits directly on top of a boiler or generator that vibrates like crazy -- it makes your ears ring and it\\'s like eating on top of a throbbing subway. i mentioned it and the waiter agreed (and said he\\'d mention it to the manager, which was great). but i was not offered another table and i hoped it would go away. (it didn\\'t.)\\n\\nbarrel house has sort of a super straight, kind of republican vibe uncharacteristic for the bella vista/queen village area. maybe the idea is to give suburbanites a place to go in the city. to the restaurant\\'s credit, it knows who its customer is, because the place was packed.\\n\\ni\\'ll go back, but for food, ambience, drinks, and neighborhood feel, i liked tapestry far better.\\ngranted they have been open for a short period of time, there was absolutely nothing good about our experience.  \\n\\na group of 6 ordered beer and food; the beer order was wrong and delayed for 45 minutes without any apologies or efforts from the staff.  we had to repeatedly ask for our beverages, including water.  the food came out at different times without apologies.  the staff was condescending and defensive.  we are very disappointed because we had high hopes that this would be a new neighborhood favorite.  \\n\\nthere is no meal/entree on the menu.  this place is strictly small plates.  the food is not good.  all 6 adults were very disappointed.  \\n\\nthere is no reason to eat here.  do not go.\\nsad to say but the food here is quite terrible.\\n\\nordered a few simple hard to miss items - pretzel bites, nachos, grilled cheese w/ tomato soup, and french fries.\\n\\nall were so so bad. i thought i ordered the safe items. i don\\'t understand how you can even mess up on those items. it just did not taste good at all. for instance, the pretzel bites didn\\'t even taste like pretzels! it was like dry bread with salt on top. it was bizarre. nachos were topped with like liquidy sour cream and cheese and a few other things. it was the saddest looking plate of nachos ever. \\n\\nanother thing that really irked me was when we ordered ice cream. i asked if we could have strawberry and vanilla since it came with a few scoops. they said no, they could not mix. i have never heard of such a thing unless it was a single scoop. whatever.\\n\\nmost likely will not be returning as there are so many other places in the area to try. so unfortunate.\\nthey always have a great draught list and happy hour specials. food is good too, and it\\'s a great spot for large groups, especially in warmer weather when you can sit outside. my favorite sandwich is the camilla: grilled chicken, guac, fontina cheese, and a sage aioli.\\npros- very comfortable surroundings, fantastic beer selection, interesting and well prepared food\\n\\ncons- pleasant but sluggish wait staff, unbelievably slow kitchen\\n\\noverall very good, and the beers soften the wait\\nman, zack was not pleased when we left the barrel house last weekend. after one slice of french toast/one egg/two slices of bacon ($7) he was still pretty hungry. although i was pretty satisfied with my bacon/egg/aoli on an english muffin (also $7), i could see where he was coming from.\\n\\nat most brunch places, french toast usually comes with two or three slices, yeah? and the menu price is usually $8 or so? c\\'mon barrel house. give the people another slice. \\n\\nadditionally, i was extremely put off by the omelet selection. i walked in craving a veggie omelet, but there was literally no way to make this happen. omelet stuffings included a strange variety of items like brie, ham, beets (???), olives (???), and \"herbs.\" wtf? \\n\\ni\\'m definitely down to try this place again for drinks, but will not be returning for brunch.\\ni really want to like this place. i love the location, i love their beer list, i love that when the weather is warm they open up all their huge windows and it\\'s a cool melding of being inside but sitting outside. \\n\\nalas, there is something just kind of lacking. and after my second visit today, i think i\\'ve figured it out - the service is lame. \\n\\nmy first time here, i sat at the bar, had some drinks, and chowed down on the mac & cheese. i liked that the bartender knew her beer, and she actually made a good recommendation for me, which is rare. but beyond that, she just wasn\\'t that friendly. granted, i don\\'t need someone who wants to listen to me recount my entire life story, peppered with awkward dating stories and poor fashion choices, but i like someone who engages a bit - and she just was not having it. that aside, the mac was good - it was a strange intense orange color, but it had a really nice flavor, a bit smokey but interesting. \\n\\na group of us came in this afternoon to have some sunday recovery drinks and again, our service was pretty lackluster. our waitress seemed less than thrilled with the fact that she was anywhere but in bed and while she wasn\\'t exactly rude, she certainly wasn\\'t charming. she spilled beer on my friend\\'s menu and laughed instead of wiping it up, went long stretches without checking on us, filling water glasses, etc. and generally tuned us out when she realized that the only food we planned on ordering was a basket of fries. to further add to the lackluster service, the bartenders, wait staff, hostess and someone who looked like a manager all hung out at a table on the floor when they weren\\'t working. they were constantly on their phones, eating food, and just acting generally completely disinterested in anything customer-related. \\n\\na part of me really does like bsbh. it\\'s a solid neighborhood spot with great beer and good food - but i prefer my neighborhood spots to be a bit more like cheers and bit less like the soup nazi.\\ni\\'ve never eaten here but the beer list is fantastic! really fun friendly bar. sit, talk, drink. yes, a bar.\\nthe beer selection is good and the atmosphere is very comfortable. the food is so-so. i\\'ve eaten here twice - the first time food was par, the second time the mussels arrived cold (tragic given a sauce that would have been excellent warm) and one of our party was completely disappointed with their pork loin entree. we live nearby and will try the place one more time - it could slip to two stars if there is no improvement.\\n\\ntried the barrel house again - they just can\\'t get the food down. the beers are great and our waitress was friendly and attentive. outside seating for drinks - that\\'s the draw.\\nwent here for dinner with a friend. the food was ok. but i think it is really pricy for what it is. i do not think the food is worth it. it might be a good place for happy hour, since it seems they have some good specials. but i would not go back if i could avoid it.\\nmonths ago, my so and i visited bsbh for burgers. they were pretty good, even if they relied too much on quirky toppings and weren\\'t all that special otherwise. service was slow, but we weren\\'t in any kind of rush so it really wasn\\'t that big of a deal. the beer list is interesting if you\\'re a beer drinker.\\n\\nfast forward to today when we showed up for brunch around 1pm with a party of 4. it was busy and looked like a lot of tables were finishing up around the same time, so we sat down and started looking over the menus. the rush died down to the point that the restaurant was nearly empty, and we continued to wait some more. a few feet away from us, three servers stood around chatting. we joked about this and even waved our menus around. at this point, we were the only party sitting in the row of booths, and those menus are big enough to direct air traffic, so it would be pretty hard to not see us.\\n\\ni\\'m a pretty patient person and understand that i\\'m not the only patron in a restaurant and not the most important person in the world. but at the 30 minute mark, in a 95% empty restaurant, now i\\'m annoyed, and i\\'m not about to beg someone to do their job.\\n\\nwe stood up, put our coats, and i said to the servers, \"hey we just sat here for a half hour with no service, so thanks.\" they looked a little confused and one mumbled \"sorry.\" \\n\\nthe brunch menu looks really good, but sadly we will not be back to try again. we\\'ll stick to restaurants where the staff actually works.\\nthey have awesome beer events. their regular beer list ain\\'t too shabby either.  \\n\\ntheir coffee beer brunch recently drew me in. they had a double-sided menu of extremely delicious and somewhat hard to find coffee beers.\\n\\nwe were able to easily call for a table the day before so we could actually eat brunch with our coffee. as my yelp followers know, i tend to lean savory in my brunch preferences. i had to hit up the sweet side with a coffee brunch. that said, my french toast burger with bacon cream cheese and whisky syrup was pretty banging. as was the baklava waffle. i tried some of my friend\\'s chicken & biscuit waffles and enjoyed that as well. \\n\\ni probably wouldn\\'t seek out bainbridge barrel house without consulting their beer list or event schedule, but it\\'s well worth the trip when the taps are hot.\\nnot bad. came in here on nye after dinner across the way. it was quiet but i preferred that. it allowed the bf and i to actually have a conversation. the beer list is extensive and had anything i could possibly want - for instance mad elf which i felt was very appropriate to the season. they did not have captain morgan (sailor jerry is a substitute but not preferred). \\n\\nbartenders were okay. a little slower toward the end of the night and a little inattentive but i\\'ve had worse.\\n \\ni didn\\'t eat here but i would like to give the board game brunch a try because a rousing game of \"sorry\" and a $5 bloody mary is all i could want in my life.\\ni have visited bainbridge street a few times for drinks only because they usually have a great rotating beer menu.  \\n\\nthis visit i decided to have dinner with a friend.  we started with the calamari and brussel sprouts-they were average.  then we proceeded to our entrees-we had the wings and burger!   these dishes were good and we were happy with our choices.  \\n\\nthe service was average and so was the food-if and when i come back it will be for the beer and spirits!\\nglad i decided to give the food another try during this visit!  we ordered the chorizo quesadilla; open-faced meatloaf sandwich; calamari & tots!  \\n\\nwe sat at the bar and i feel like this allowed a better connection with our server who was attentive and made great suggestions for our meal and beers that we sampled!\\n\\nall of our food was seasoned very well and the rotation of beers continue to impress!  \\n\\nkeeping the barrel house in my more frequent rotation of places to enjoy a good happy hour!\\n\\n1/2 off draft beers during happy hour - 4:30p-6:30p!\\nto celebrate our anniversary, the gf and i went to the society hill dance academy for some private ballroom lessons. afterwards, we decided to stop by dmitri\\'s for lunch. unfortunately, they were closed, so we walked a few blocks west and came upon bainbridge street barrel house. \\n\\nin addition to providing bar bites, they host quizzo and do bottomless brunch with bloody mary\\'s and mimosas for $20!\\n\\nthe farmhouse [$13]\\n8 oz. blend of pat la frieda ground beef, farm fresh goat cheese, cremini mushrooms, red onions, greens, st. somewhere saison athene aioli, brioche \\n\\nthe gf was in the mood for a burger and luckily for her, pat la frieda beef was on offer. the burger came out medium as requested and was nicely crusted and juicy. the savory mushrooms and the tang of the goat cheese helped to create a great bite. the sesame-studded brioche held the innards nicely. the vinegary tang of the aioli showcased the floral notes of the beer and the accompanying fries were well-seasoned. \\n\\npork belly benedict [$10]\\n\\nwhen i saw that pork belly was on special, i obviously had to order it. unfortunately, the pork belly was lacking and this particular dish was not exactly on bar with green eggs\\' iteration. still, the pastrami-cure on the thinly sliced pork belly was interesting, with the mustard seeds providing some pop in the hollandaise. the potato hash was creamy and well-seasoned and the fresh fruit helped as a palate cleanser. still, a bit disappointed in the dish overall.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nthe gf and i came back after inviting some friends to check out bainbridge\\'s quizzo. advertised as starting at 7/7:30pm, the games began closer to 8pm. not incredibly busy like fado, there were about 8 teams on tuesday night.\\n\\nkentucky orchards [$9]\\napplewood infused buffalo trace, fernet branca, lillet blanc, apple cider, honey syrup\\n\\ni decided to start off the night with some applewood-infused buffalo trace bourbon, which was brightened up with apple cider and honey. nicely light and smokey.\\n\\ncicharron special [$4]\\n\\nhad to order the pig skins, which were freshly fried and covered in subtly smoky espelette spice mix.\\n\\nbeer battered pickles [$5]\\nwhiskey aioli\\n\\nwe also went with the fried pickles, which were not as good as kite and key\\'s and showcased a chewy batter. definitely could have used a thinner coating and some more time in the fryer.\\n\\nfish & chips [$17]\\nbeer battered haddock, fries, housemade tartar sauce  \\n\\nthe gf went with the fish and chips, which also had a well-seasoned, yet chewy batter. still, the fish was flaky and meaty. the accompanying fries were crisp and nicely fried.\\n\\nsally smothers [$13]\\n8 oz. pat la frieda, fried egg, pancetta, sharp provolone, fried shallots, mayo, brioche\\n\\ni went with another of bainbridge\\'s pat la frieda burgers, which had good flavor and was moist. the fried shallots were a nice touch, though the pancetta seemed a bit lost. the sharp provolone and fried egg helped to bring each bite over the top. \\n\\noverall, bainbridge seems to do burgers decently, but has more than its share of missteps. in fact, the gf ordered a diet pepsi that tasted of chlorine. seems that this was the case in some of the other reviews on yelp as well.\\ngreat spot in south philly for sunday brunch. the selection of craft beers is adequate and the $5 momosas are what brunch is all about! belgain waffles with anything on it are great here. the \"chicken & biscuit waffle\" was a hefty portion that will leave a full grown man satisified. the chicken was so crispy and perfectly cooked. the \"pears foster waffle\" with caramelized pears and whipped cream on top was sweet and savory. i added a side of bacon as well. we had such a good time here... brunch turned into an all day affair.... lol.\\nopted to stop in this watering hole prior to dinner nearby. pretty awesome interior with lots of wood grains. \\n\\na bar and restaurant with moderate natural lighting from larger windows giving ample unobstructed view of the outside. outdoor seating available also.\\n\\ndecided to have a cocktail on such a warm, (nÃ©e hot) day. sat at the bar on this visit. the bartender, johnny, a strikingly handsome man but what was more impressive was his endearing personality and communication exchange with my party and i as well as the other bar patrons. he was personable without being intrusive. additionally, he made an excellent drink for me, strawberry maison, which was mildly sweet with the aromatic flavors is strawberries & basil and the subtle whisky chaser. looking at the beer menu was fun as it offered some really creative brews that made me want to return. especially after having a sample of a peppermint beer, minty delish.\\n\\nin a few weeks, this will be a place to come back to with friends to try some flights and other beer options.. impressive 1st impression of this unexpected bar/restaurant off south street..\\ncame here last night with some friends for drinks and snacks. we were all satisfied with our libations; specifically my pear cosmo was very yummy and the hot toddy totally hit the spot. \\n\\ngiving a little leeway for the fact that they just opened, the food was fine and needs some tweaking. the falafel burger was really more a chickpea patty on a bun, and everything on the plate was brown so it would be much improved with some color and different textures added. the skin crisps were like really thin fries, made for a nice little snack but didn\\'t have much flavor. the actual fries were pretty basic, tasty enough; i got them with the caramelized onions and wiz which were both tasty but once i got through the ones on the top was left with unadorned fries on the bottom of the bowl, kind of like when you get ice cream with sprinkles.\\n\\ni\\'ll probably give them a few more weeks and try again to see if they\\'ve worked out some of the kinks. i did like the interior and the mason jar lights are really cool.\\ni like this place.  it has a lot of potential.  the bar tender could be friendlier.  he basically does his job, but you feel like you are kind of bothering him.  i got the feeling he was unhappy we ordered happy hour drinks.  i\\'d still go back, but a bit of friendliness goes a long way when it comes to getting people to return.\\nwhat a nice brunch place! came here saturday around 11:30 am for a friend\\'s birthday and we had a party of 12. i\\'m always skeptical about large groups at busy brunch times, but it worked out great.\\n\\ni wish they had prepaid bottomless or pitcher deals, but the $5 mimosas and bloody mary\\'s aren\\'t too shabby, either. i stuck with mimosas that morning and they were adequately filled with champagne, so i had a nice buzz going.  my friends enjoyed their bloody mary\\'s, as well.\\n\\nthe several menus were a bit overwhelming (brunch food menu, expansive draft beer menu, dinner special menu, dessert menu), plus chalkboards boasting homemade ice creams and more dinner specials. i would love to visit back here for dinner and a beer and try that side of the menu.\\n\\ni opted for the french toast blt which was...okay.  even as i read the description, i thought the lettuce and tomato would be a weird combo with french toast, and i should\\'ve stuck with my gut. the french toast itself was tasty and battered nicely, but the fried egg on top made it impossible to eat it like an actual blt sandwich. the b was crispy and good, but there was just way too much l and t. i should\\'ve just ordered french toast with bacon on the side.  homefries were delicious, but they skimped on the portion.\\n\\nthey have really great vegan/vegetarian options.  half my group was one or the other and they all thoroughly enjoyed their vegan hashes, breakfast burritos, omelettes, etc.  we also surprised the birthday boy with a homemade vegan sorbet with cardamom and home grown plums...interesting and spicy, but tasty.\\n\\noverall, for 12 people, it was approximately $230 (i think?) before tip, which i don\\'t think is bad at all considering the amount of booze.  \\n\\nalso, major props to our server (tall male with glasses, i can\\'t remember his name!) who was really on top of everything (including guests that showed up later than planned) and super friendly and informative.\\ni\\'ll keep this short and sweet.\\none recent afternoon, i had the chance to eat my favorite meal here - brunch, and ordered the french toast burger ( yes, you read that right). interesting, delicious, untraditional yet presented simply and unpretentiously. \\n\\nit is a win-win; good food and good prices.\\nthree and three quarters yelps.\\nwhat a relief. great service great eats, dined outside mother\\'s day w/ my lady aka mama and my brother. everything was awesome. i had the smoked salmon nicoise salad, calamari, and fries, mom had the fish and chips and wings, brother had a grilled chicken sandwich and fries....everything was delectable can\\'t wait to go back.\\nwhat a relief. great service great eats, dined outside mother\\'s day w/ my lady aka mama and my brother. everything was awesome. i had the smoked salmon nicoise salad, calamari, and fries, mom had the fish and chips and wings, brother had a grilled chicken sandwich and fries....everything was delectable can\\'t wait to go back.\\ncame back here again and was still impressed! got brunch and the variety of food selections was pretty solid. there was a french toast burger, pumpkin waffles with fried chicken, and i got a breakfast burrito (staple, but a classic). \\n\\nall of the food was very good. well flavored and not too pricey. my burrito came with a huge mound of home fries and fruit. beer selection is also great. i was impressed with both the service and the food so i\\'ll definitely try coming back here again!\\ni came her for the duclaw tap take over, and had a blast! our waiter was a little confused with our order because it was soooo busy and there were many customers that looked alike (random, i know). but still, the waiter maintained great composure. he brought us the wrong beer and allowed us to keep it (it was fantastic so nobody was too upset).\\n\\ni\\'m giving this place 4 stars because even though the service wasn\\'t the most amazing, i think all waiters/waitresses and bartenders did the best they could with the circumstances. i saw all of them hustling and making sure all customers were doing ok. for me a sign of a good waiter is when the waters get refreshed. although mine was refreshed only once, i still consider this an amazing feat seeing as the place was crawling with people. we literally could not find a place to stand.\\n\\nin the future, i would come back. although hoping for better crowd control next time ;)\\nmost of the reviews are pretty spot on. good beer list. good food. nice large open windows are great when the weather is nice. but the service needs improvement. we find ourselves waiting a while for drinks, and last time we went, our checks were all wrong.\\nthis is a great casual spot in the neighborhood with a wide beer selection.  there are so many beers on tap, i lost count. the staff is friendly and i never had to wait longer than just a few minutes to get a new drink if i had an empty glass.  \\n\\nthe food selection is very good too! i love the fired calamari. it was seriously the best calamari appetizer i have had in the city! i can\\'t wait to go back. it\\'s crispy, fresh and delicious. try it.\\nbainbridge street barrel house is a great neighborhood spot for beer and a various menu. i have been here several times but recently i had dinner and i really enjoyed it but i don\\'t really think it\\'s a 5-star dinner spot. i had a great experience with friendly service, and a great selection but still not 5-star rating material. \\n\\ni started off with apps.  nachos and crispy calamari. the nachos are very messy but tasty. the \\'best calamari appetizer in the city\\' that i proclaimed it as last review did not live up to it\\'s expectations because it was not as crispy and could have used an extra minute in the fryer. the sauce is still as good as i remember it being in the winter!  \\n\\ni had the beet salad as my main course and it was really a great portion for a salad. it was $9 and i think it was a good value based on the amount of goat cheese that was topped on it.\\npretty extensive draft list. all of the staff were so friendly and welcoming, however it wasn\\'t enough to really set itself apart compared to other types of pubs and gastropubs in the area. the food is really spread apart -- ranging from an ahi tuna poke bowl to lamb dolmas. maybe tightening up the menu to have a specific focus and taste would be good for differentiating the restaurant side of things.\\ni came here twice in 4 days (maybe i have a problem) but i can fairly critique bsbh now that i have consumed bevs and food.\\n\\nmy first time here was post the ee event and our bartender scott mixed up an amazing bourbon cocktail that made me rethink my dislike for bourbon, so much so i had another round. we hung out at the bar ,had inappropriate conversations and rang in rebecca s\\'s birthday in style.\\n\\nmy second appearance was yesterday for sunday brunch. we were seated at a high top in the bar area and service just wasnt on like i felt like it should have been. we waited a while for stuff (orders placed, food to come, refills on coffee and water)\\n the food was just ok. i ordered eggs and you really cant mess those up but i can say the breakfast potatoes were good and they gave plenty along with a fall type fruit salad that made my two egg breakfast very filling. i had one bev the meyer lemon champagne punch that was pretty much bubbly goodness. my brunch companions all order various things, french toast, lox,chicken & waffles and the group was split between amazing and just ok. id probably venture back to try out the other menu offerings maybe for hh or an early dinner. there are so many brunch options ( on that corner alone) to head back there just yet. \\n\\nthey offer a pretty solid draft & bottle list for those beer lovers and the cocktail options are a plenty. price wise its pretty spot on for brunch in qv.\\nok -  it took a few weeks, but wife and i finally got here tonight. i never took the time to read reviews prior to going - so we went on a blank slate. i had no idea until now that there were so many yelpers who had issues w/ bsbh.\\n\\nlove the look of the place from the outside when driving down bainbridge. also, major kudos for the revolving door - where do you see a door like that in a neighborhood tap room? no where - way too cool! the huge windows are awesome too! this place lights up the whole corner. the design of the interior is nice and warm. it was about 7pm. greeted very nicely by hostess as we walked in. \\n\\nthe service throughout the whole meal was very good. granted they weren\\'t that busy on a monday night, but our server was always coming by our table at just the right time - and she was warm and pleasant. what more could you want? (good food!)\\n\\nhad a pint of the ithaca flower power - good stuff!.\\n\\nanyway, the problem was the food. we ordered very simply:\\n\\n1- pulled pork fries w/ jalapeno and sour cream. the fries were tasty, but needed to be cooked through more - many were limp and close to being soggy. some folks may like \\'em this way, but they could have been crispier. the amount of pork was proper for a $6 dish. the pork itself tasted good or adequate - but i was hoping for it to blow my socks off like the pulled pork tots at the institute did last winter - i\\'m still thinking about those tots!  bsbh needs to add a little more love to make their pork above average.\\n\\n2- the mussels puttanesca was a disaster. my wife had to take a pass on them after tasting the 1st one. they were not cooked completely. the shells were fully opened, but the mussels war seriously undercooked. i tried one too - definitely not cooked enough, and very little flavor. my wife said the red sauce wasn\\'t very good either. the grilled bread that came with it looked good, we never tried it.\\n\\n3- the greek salad was lame. in hindsight, i wish i had thought to take a photo of it. there\\'s 2 things i have to order in a place that i\\'ve never been to if it\\'s on the menu - chicken noodle soup and greek salad. why? because those are 2 things that i make real good myself and i\\'m always looking to see if someone else can make it as good or better. the presentation was nice, but then it was downhill:\\n\\nthe greens were spring mix or something similar, not romaine or green/red leaf. that in itself is not a problem, but they were a small pile in the middle of the bowl and soaked limp with dressing that wasn\\'t a good greek salad dressing - it needed more lemon and red wine vinegar.  there were only two small cubes of feta. are you kidding me? no really! are you kidding me!! what the ....! the salad is $10 - not a 5 or 6 dollar salad. how do you put less than an ounce of feta in a $10 greek salad? the cut up grape tomatoes are a nice touch and much tastier than regular tomatoes, but there could have been more - it seemed like it was 3 grape tomatoes cut in half. the kalamata olives were cut in half and on the light side too. also, the cucumbers were few and far between. the only thing there was plenty of was red bell pepper.\\n\\ni was really expecting better things from this kitchen. it\\'s not that i know anything about the chef or owner - but it\\'s clear a ton of money was put into this place. i watched them build it out over the last few months and assumed the owner/investors would make sure the entire food experience was on par with the strong competition in our city from the first day open. with all the excellent dining options in philly, you can\\'t afford to take a few weeks to work out the kinks. just sayin\\'.\\nwent here twice, ate outside once (when it was warm out) and than sat near the bar the 2nd time. service was quick, almost too quick! didn\\'t have time to decide but at least we weren\\'t forgotten about ! decent beer selection and nice food menu. portions were good and everything tastes good !\\nwent here one evening to celebrate some accomplishments with food and beer. food was delicious and drinks were good, but i spent way more than i was anticipating. nothing was wrong, it just seemed like the quality of food and service was not anywhere near the bill total. it might just be that i was expecting more of a casual dining experience because i definitely get more of a \"bar\" vibe here as opposed to a restaurant vibe.\\n\\nthe mussels in coconut curry sauce was the most memorable item on the menu. it was so flavorful and just all around a perfect dish. i just wanted to dip my bread in it all evening it was out of this world good.\\n\\ni\\'d go back for a drink with friends.\\nok this place definitely gets bumped up since my last review. \\n\\nbrunch in the city is sometimes a difficult choice when hosting guests that don\\'t live in the city. you want to take them somewhere nice and memorable, but it\\'s tough because majority of places don\\'t take reservations for brunch and you can wait upwards of an hour for a table. \\n\\ni was desparately racking my brain as my guests arrived, and then it hit me. good ole barrel house! they have plenty of seating and a perfect setup to enjoy beautiful summer weather. we were seated right when we walked in and there were lots of people going in and out.\\n\\nlooking at the menu, it was so hard to narrow down what we wanted because everything looked awesome. we ordered:\\n\\n1. apple pie french toast- ehh it was okay.. wasn\\'t a huge fan. the apple syrup/sauce made the meal messy and soggy and it definitely wasn\\'t the tastiest\\n\\n2. biscuits and sausage gravy with a fried egg - ugh so amazing. i could have licked the bowl clean.\\n\\n3. build your own omelette with bacon, spinach and goat cheese - hands down the best omelette i\\'ve ever eaten. it was huge and delicious, and came with a side of potatoes with old bay seasoning. even my 4 year old neice couldn\\'t get enough. this was definitely a favorite for all three of us.\\n\\nto top it all off my sister and i enjoyed the $5 mimosas as well as wonderful service. will i come back for brunch? heck yea i will. should you stop by for brunch? heck yea you should.\\ni came here only because they had the critically acclaimed hill farmstead double galaxy beer. it\\'s only available at the brewery in vermont and is very rarely in the philadelphia area on tap. it managed to kick right before i got there (even though it was still on the menu that is shown on a tv above the bar), so i ended up with a founders kbs, a widely distributed (once a year) barrel-aged stout. it was really good, but it wasn\\'t the one i wanted. \\n\\nlater that night, i was disappointed to find they tapped a different critically acclaimed beer after i left, maine dinner, that is only available at the brewery in maine. i\\'ve only seen it in the philadelphia area once before where it kicked after an hour.  \\n\\nthey need to do a better job changing kegs and updating the menu on the tv, especially when it comes to these rare beers that aren\\'t available anywhere else in philadelphia.\\ntrivia night here was a really fun one. while the tables filled up pretty quickly and there were some big groups, we still managed to get a gift card for the next time we come. the food menu is pretty extensive, and our table enjoy the appetizer, bourdon, and beer combo- that night was brussel sprouts with parm and a white creamy sauce. the nachos weren\\'t the cheesiest, but everyone enjoyed the bites we got. drinks are reasonable and i enjoyed the ambience, will be back!\\nvinny\\'s after party spot of choice is terrific in my book. \\n\\nmy friends live around the corner and i had passed this several times. it was just too bright i felt. i like dim places to drink. think franklin mortgage, fergies, etc. i don\\'t want to see the floor well. \\n\\nwe came after the fire&ice event. i liked that the wait staff was not overwhelmed by a group of 10-15 yelpers most with our name tags on, halo\\'s and pitchforks still festooned. they took our drink orders swiftly and executed them well, except for my 2nd drink which was not made with the right spirit, but i drank it!\\n\\ni really enjoyed their old-fashioned. it is made just how i love it. muddled cherry and orange please! order it with rittenhouse rye and you can\\'t go wrong. i could drink these forever!\\n\\ni cannot speak of the food. however, tonight i walked past and the specials board had spicy spelled spicey. that kinda stuff irks me. i know it\\'s petty, but it does. \\n\\ni would like to try to the food, but i would like even more to have a pitcher of old-fashioneds!\\notherwise known as vinny\\'s after party spot of choice. and after two of those after parties and a good visit for food i think i can understand why!\\n\\nthe first thing i love about the barrel house\\'s space is how well designed and timeless it looks considering the serious renovation that went into it. add in a quality drink list with drafts that rotate amicably, an inspiring yet oftentimes wonky food menu, and quality service; and you have another spot to look out for in the growing queen village area. \\n\\nevery time i\\'ve been here i\\'ve been beyond impressed with the draft lists that i\\'ve bared witness to. with its cask conditioned, nitro, and numerous drafts it definitely manages to bring forth a great amount of brews on an ever changing basis. but it also wouldn\\'t be a barrel house if it didn\\'t have a great spirits list backing it up. and you can definitely score a quality cocktail especially if you\\'re looking for the old fashioned variety,\\n\\nas far as the menu goes my dining partners and myself have experienced hit and miss. bold in both extremes its menu definitely likes to go bold and offers up some insteresting ingredients for better and worse results. while the grilled brussel sprouts with bacon that i ordered was a promising revelation, the deep fried pickles i ordered out of curiosity suffered from a heat inconsistency and took a long while to reach a temperature that made them tolerable. meanwhile my friend failed to make sense of of the raisin mostarda, spinach, and blue cheese that came with his burger meister burger. but in both instances we easily ordered wrong to our likings, and could have easily found something in its big menu that would have better fit our tastes. its a big enough menu that it could stand to have some fat trimmed from it, but its definitely admirable in what it brings to the table.\\n\\nthe big thumbs up for me comes with their service though since i haven\\'t experienced a bad one. in fact when my dining partner managed to loose a $20 from his pocket, the host even made a point to track him down and bring it to its rightful owner. it doesn\\'t get better than that by my book.\\ni came here on a random wednesday night with a girlfriend. it\\'s a very cute place tucked on a quiet corner of bainbridge. i\\'m glad we \"discovered\" it and i am looking forward to a return visit. \\n\\nit had a big long bar, some tall bar tables and regular tables. oh and plenty of outdoor seating too.  nothing super special about the decor but it was still a pleasant atmosphere. \\n\\nprobably most impressive was the beer list. 250+ bottles plus drafts, prices seemed pretty normal for the city. although no italian beers....  the food menu was nice and the fried pickle chips we shared were good. i\\'d like to return for a proper meal. \\n\\nour server was really nice and helpful in pointing out beers we may like. always a plus to have a knowledgeable server.\\nwe decided to come here for dinner and drinks and i became a bit nervous as i read other people\\'s reviews. i\\'m just glad i didn\\'t let it deter us from coming! maybe they\\'ve hired new waitstaff or improved training for their former waitstaff, but our server, john, was fantastic. i don\\'t have 1 bad thing to say about him. we weren\\'t super hungry so we enjoyed the bbq wings (great value with 10 very big, saucy wings) and the fries, which were very good. i had the cucumber gin (house infused) martini and it was only $9! lots of gin, refreshingly cucumbery, and very strong! fiance had a glass of wine (the wine list was good for a place that specializes in beer). the outdoor seating was great. honestly i can\\'t say anything bad about this spot! i hope other will give it another chance.\\ni\\'ve been to bainbridge street barrel house a few times, but usually for tap takeover beer events, so never enough to warrant a full yelp review.  the beers are usually pretty good, but yes, the service is quite slow when there\\'s big beer events. \\n\\nanyway, i finally ate at bainbridge, so i feel i can give a deserving review.  we came for brunch on a sunday morning.  it was nice there was no wait, which every other bruch place was quoting us 30-45 mins.  however, i can see why there\\'s no wait.  the food was just ok, not bad, but not speical either.  considering the tough competition of bruch spots in philly, bainbridge barrel house falls short of the competition.\\n\\nservice was great, very friendly, and super nice.  however, the added spinach i requested in my omelet was missing, and one of my friends didn\\'t get her meal until we were all half done eating ours.  but besides that, service was great (could have been a kitchen issue, who knows).\\n\\nfood:  average.  my omelet was huge, and pretty good, despite missing the spinach.  it was very cheesy which i appreciated.  the hash browns were good too.  the salmon benedict looked ok, and my friend said it was \"pretty good.\"  the sausage hash was recommended by the waitress, which came in a skillet pot with sunny side up egg on top.  the presentation looked yummy, and hearty, but the taste was slighly bland and just \"good.\"  nothing amazing.  the chicken and waffles was very underwhelming, small dry quarters of waffles, with little syrup on top, and an average size fried chicken on top.  nothing else.. not enough syrup to juicen up the dry waffles.  no eggs, no hash browns, nothing else, boring. \\n\\noverall, this place has its wins and its misses.  its not bad, but its also not the greatest.  i\\'ll be back for beer events, but i\\'m not going out of my way to come here just for food.\\nmy mom and i came here for brunch on mother\\'s day. it was a beautiful day out and we opted to sit by the open windows. it wasn\\'t too busy inside. my mom was craving eggs, but we ended up ordering mom\\'s chicken & waffles and french toast burger. this was our first experience having chicken and waffles! the rosemary wasn\\'t too strong in the waffles. we didn\\'t get enough of the whiskey syrup and asked for more. we were given the regular syrup. the french toast burger was something else and something worth trying. i was afraid of having a heart attack afterwards, but i was ok. that was our favorite dish between the two. \\nour server could have been more attentive. a good thing was that our water cups were always filled, thanks to the helper.\\ni\\'m basing this review on the beer selection, this is a barrel house after all. it\\'s a great, extensive list of beers on tap, including a cask. in this neighborhood, i think this is definitely your choice of a pub if you\\'re looking for an out of the ordinary selection of brews. certainly is mine. the food looks like good pub fare, as i observed someone at the bar tucking into what looked like a fried oyster po\\'boy.\\ni liked the space! they had booths facing the tvs so we got to sit cafe style while watching a game. they had a great beer list and we did like the fried pickles. the menu was fine but it didn\\'t wow me. \\n\\ni\\'d go again but i think the three stars is appropriate for this cozy bar food place. it might be a good party venue. maybe i will update the review next time. i certainly like the area!\\na truly delicious old fashioned and every appetizer was awesome. it\\'s also in a great location with the ability to sit and drink here or go out afterwards (a short walk to many south philly bars).\\nbsbh is a good place to grab a beer if you\\'re in the area. we spent some time here the night before thanksgiving and found it to be good in some ways and needing improvement in others. overall, i think they\\'ve got the idea right and just need to continue to refine their methods. \\n\\nservice: we walked in and stood at the host/ess stand for while before someone came by to seat us. that\\'s one thing they may want to work on since it\\'s the first impression people get when they come in. on the upside, when the host came over, he was nice and let us sit at the table we wanted. our waiter was also nice and efficient in brining our food and drinks. i also appreciated that they were very patient with our ever-growing party, as more of our friends arrived over the course of the evening. \\n\\nbeer: as the name of the restaurant somewhat implies, beer is the star of the show. we actually came here because they were doing a chocolate stout night, with about a dozen or so interesting chocolate stout picks on draft. coming from someone loves this style of beer, i have to say that they made all the right picks in forming their lineup. \\n\\nfood: food had mixed reactions out our table. i wasn\\'t that hungry and ordered the chicken fingers. the good part is that they were clearly made from scratch. the downside is that there is some kind of structural flaw with the breading, as it falls off the chicken as soon as you dip it into the housemade honey-dijon sauce. this should be pretty easy to fix, but would be a big difference. my wife enjoyed her beet salad, which came on a nice bed of frisee and was nicely dressed, and others at the table enjoyed the burger, which was cooked to the requested temperature and had a beautiful red color to the meat. \\n\\noverall, i would come back here. i probably wouldn\\'t go out of my way unless they were doing another event like the chocolate stout night, though. i\\'m optimistic that bsbh will get even better over time.\\nnot the best but it will do.  i was really excited about this new addition to the neighborhood and will probably give it another try in the future, but the first visit wasn\\'t great.  normally i don\\'t visit so close to opening as things are still being tweaked, and my hope is that things will get a bit tighter in the coming weeks.\\n\\nwe started with the popcorn which was fine.  it was cold with a dusting of chili lime flavor.  a good bar snack for a couple bucks.  we also tried the pork belly with collards and cider vinegar.  the pork belly was dry and the cider vinegar or glaze was mostly stuck to the bowl.  what i could scrape off tasted pretty good though.  overall, i probably wouldn\\'t order this again.\\n\\ni opted for the cod sandwich which was a pretty big disappointment.  the fish wasn\\'t crispy at all so i just felt like i was biting into a big mush ball.  overall it was pretty bland, even after kicking it up with a little ketchup.  my wife opted for the lamb gyro which she enjoyed, but wasn\\'t overwhelmed by.  the fries were standard but the highlight of the meal; so maybe we\\'ll try some of the inventive fry offerings next time.\\n\\nservice was fine and the biggest highlight was the bruery autumn maple being on tap.  kudos for that one!  the beer list was quality as well, although a dollar or two more than i would expect to pay for some of the drafts.  either way, good to have a new spot, i dig the atmosphere, just hope the kitchen tweaks things a bit in the coming weeks to bring the food quality up.\\nbrunch at this place was pretty damn delicious. they have a great draft list with plenty of tasty craft options too mainly from local breweries. \\n\\nfor brunch i got smoked salmon benedict and it was probably the best and most reasonably priced i\\'ve had in the city. it came loaded with homefries and berry fruit salad (even with a nice surprise of gooseberries!). not a huge fan of hollandaise sauce usually but bainbridge made it not so overwhelmingly thick, and had good flavor. it was actually cheaper than smoked salmon brunch options normally are too. \\n\\neveryone else i was with got some great meals as well. my boyfriend who has had a streak of bad burgers, really enjoyed his here and my friend even got a french toast burger that had maple whiskey cream cheese instead of ketchup, which i thought was really clever. \\n\\ni don\\'t know how this place is for dinner but i would definitely come back for the good beers and brunch. you have to respect a bar that goes local with their brews and does it total justice with their descriptions. service was pretty good. not outstanding, but some of the servers were really friendly. i was debating on 5 stars but decided although it was really good, its not on my top list of places around here.\\nhadn\\'t heard much at all about this place, so i was kind of excited to try it hoping it would be a great new neighborhood bar without being trendy or over the top.\\n\\npork fries: excellent flavor to the pulled pork but the fries were way overfried and as crunchy as potato chips.  unseasoned, you desperatley needed to salt your own fries.\\n\\nhouse burger: meat was so densly packed it had the weight of a hockey puck.  no seasoning and the meat blend was all wrong, it actually had a slight liver aftertaste. i\\'m guessing there\\'s some filet in the mix as there was no detectable fat content to the meat and if you squeezed the \"medium rare\" burger there was no pink inside and no juices coming out.   the roll was a soggy english muffin...complete failure, i didn\\'t finish mine.\\n\\nthe short rib taco sounded great but somehow there was no flavor to the meat.  there was a \"grav\" sauce  on the meat, but it might as well have been water as it had no flavor.  the tacos needed some spice and some acid.  the salad tasted undressed, there was nothing at all making this a \"taco\".  it was some bland mead on mini baked tortilla.\\n\\nhighly recommended you avoid their food, total waste of money and time\\n\\ni still cant believe how there was just no flavor to their food!\\n\\nambiance is cool.  for a mid-week lunch there was only 1 other table there so no issues with the wait.  the waiter and the bartender were both very pleasant and attentive.\\nso understaffed!\\nsaturday night dinner time and our waitress or any wait staff was do hard to get a hold of. slow service and our food took so long.\\nthe good us decent. the farmers burger with the goat cheese was really good. was not asked how i like my meat cooked. fries  were good.\\ncrab cake burger was pretty tasty. side salad had a light gingerish dressing.\\ngood beer selection and pretty nice vibe/decor.\\ni wouldn\\'t go back purely cause the service was so inattentive. can\\'t blame it all on the waitress as the she was swamped. still would have been nice for her to check in it refill water.\\n3.5 stars. nice large space with a large bar. i have only had drinks here so can\\'t comment on the food. bartenders have been friendly as are the patrons they have tvs to watch sporting events.\\nnice neighborhood spot! 3.5 stars.\\n\\nit\\'s a place that recently opened, and i wanted to check it out. since it was my friend\\'s birthday, it was the perfect time to combine good friends and good drinks. the place is really gorgeous! i loved the mason jar light fixtures and the contemporary wood furniture. it wasn\\'t crowded, so our table of four was able to sit at one of the hightop tables near the bar. service was pretty attentive, but it wasn\\'t too busy anyway.\\n\\ncan\\'t comment on the food, so let\\'s focus on the drinks. they tried to add a few twists to the classics, and it was a nice attempt. the drinks were \"meh.\" i ordered the apple manhattan, while she ordered the pear cosmo. my drink had a bit too much bourbon to balance the apple flavor, and hers was just way too sweet. i let our server know what we thought, so hopefully if and when they get ordered again, it won\\'t be such a mishap! however, the sauvignon blanc and the champagne we ordered next made us forget the tastes of our first drink.\\n\\ni wasn\\'t in the mood for beer, but the list was extraordinary! nice choices for craft brews and rotating drafts! my other friends ordered second glasses for their beers, so that is definitely a good sign.\\n\\nsince it was my friend\\'s birthday, we surprised her with apple pie a la mode! the dessert was delicious and a sweet way to end the night.\\n\\nmy next visit will be to try the menu!\\noverpriced meal for very small portions.  the selection of food is mediocre at best and i honestly thought they brought the child\\'s size for my wife\\'s meal.  if you just want to drink beers, the selection is good.  don\\'t waste your time eating here because you will leave hungry.  the food was ok, nothing spectacular\\nwe decided to stop in today for brunch! it\\'s seems that the consensus is that this place doesn\\'t have enough staff to accommodate for the brunch rush! we waited about twenty minutes to be seated but then waited 45 minutes for an order of scrambled eggs and a burger! i could tell that the food was taking a while as the table next to us complained about starving and i could feel the heat their impatience.\\nthe waitress was very apologetic, as she was well aware of the amount of time we were sitting there and kept our coffee cup filled.\\ni got the standard eggs, some bacon, scrapple and home fries, the portions were big and the food was good, but not so good that i would have waited that long.\\ndh got the pork roll sandwich, he said it was ok, but the biscuit was overpowering since there wasn\\'t much egg or pork roll in the sandwich- however the french fries were really yummy! at least all the food was hot.\\ngreat location, great atmosphere, but the service is awful- nothing on the server\\'s part she was gracious and well aware that the food was taking forever!\\nwe had our 21 month old with us and you can only keep the little one entertained for so long before they go stir crazy! thankfully when the food came he calmed down, needless to say we were done eating and ready for the check within 15 minutes of our food arriving!\\nfor the amount of time we waited- our experience should have been spectacular! i wasn\\'t hungry when we arrived, but was starving by the time the food came out- you shouldn\\'t make a pregnant woman wait for food, i actually started nibbling on my son\\'s snacks that we brought! i asked for bread to hold me over, during the wait and they were going to charge me for it, i mean come on! i think, we\\'ll have to pass on this place- i don\\'t think it\\'s a coincidence that we\\'ve been here twice and all i can remember is the wait both times!  it\\'s probably better to go to the bar, grab a beer and plop yourself in front of the tv kind of place.\\ni\\'ve read mixed reviews about the food and drink at the barrel house. but we ventured here on cinco de mayo for brunch, not knowing what to expect.  we were seated outside at one of the curbside tables, big plus that the tables aren\\'t crooked, that drives me nuts. our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive beer list. she made some great recommendations to my husband, who is very picky when it comes to his hops! he was pleasantly please with the drafts he had.\\nthe food was really good, however it took an excruciatingly long time for it to actually reach the table, let\\'s just say we finished two drinks a piece before our food arrived. it was a gorgeous day and we weren\\'t starving or in a hurry, so it wasn\\'t the end of the world, but it was a wait nonetheless and if we were in a hurry, it would have been very annoying. the food was fresh and the portions were huge. i tried the french toast, which was fluffy and drenched in a delicious walnut caramel syrup, it was ala carte so it was disappointing that it didn\\'t come with a side.  he had the italian omelette complete with a side of roasted home fries and mixed fruit. we got french fries to munch on before our plates arrived, not knowing that the food was already on its way out. the fries we piping hot and just the perfect, i could have eaten 4 pounds of it!\\nthe bar inside was jammed packed with locals enjoying the phillies game. all in all, we had a really nice time and since we are moving into the neighborhood, we will be stopping by here more frequently!\\ni really enjoy bsbh. i\\'ve been here a few times and more recently with elaine m. for some saturday night brews and dinner during march madness.  we sat at the bar and had a few beers.  had we been basketball fans, this would have been an added bonus because there are several tvs that line the bar which are viewable from all directions. nice work.  \\n\\nthe bartenders were pretty good with giving us adequate attention and i thought the beer list was pretty solid.  for dinner we split the fried calamari app which was yummy and the sally smothers burger.  the burger hit the spot- beef burger with shallots, pancetta, provolone and a fried egg. score.   \\n\\nafter dinner we enjoyed a couple more beers and then suddenly bainbridge street barrel house turned into antarctica.  no idea how or why, but the place was 20 degrees and severely uncomfortable.  i mentioned the temperature to a server who brushed me off and didn\\'t seem to care that the cast from frozen was throwing a rager in the back of the house.  thanks, bro. coats already on, we paid and left.  \\n\\nbsbh is a good bar for beers, casual but more creative pub fare and a low key night.\\nmy first visit was a sunday brunch, a solo exploratory mission.\\n\\ni sat at the bar. the beer list and the bartender made positive initial impressions. i had the scrapple benedict and several beers. i left fairly content and certain to return. \\n\\none observation i made was that if both the bar tables and the bar are occupied, there\\'s little clearance in between. that\\'s fine when no one is trying to get by, but when there\\'s a steady flow of traffic coming through nudging your chair, it does get annoying.\\n\\nmy second visit was for dinner. we were seated in the dining room and ordered the hummus, wings and two varieties of burgers.\\n\\nthe hummus was bland. the wings were just okay and the burgers were a big disappointment. they sounded good based on the descriptions in the menu and they looked good based on their presentation on the plate, but we tore into them and were underwhelmed. i really expected a couple of home runs. what we got were mediocre burgers at best. they were overdone (requested medium, received well) and impotent. neither fried egg nor blue cheese gave them much life at all. \\n\\noverall, i would best describe our dinner experience as forgettable. i didn\\'t leave hating the place, we just expected better. i felt like their ambitions are in one league, while what the kitchen delivered was in another. i left thinking, \"just stick to beers at the bar if you come back.\" \\n\\nmy third visit was on a lovely saturday spent day-drinking.\\n\\ni sat at the bar which was about half-full. there was one bartender on duty (a different one from my first visit). he was serving people then returned to restocking duties as a bar back appeared with product. i waited patiently to order, then waited and waited...and waited some more! ten plus minutes later he took my order. i was literally twiddling my thumbs at the bar. \\n\\nstrike one.\\n\\ni order a stout. the bartender opens the tap, fills and serves me...a glass of foam. i just looked at it paralyzed with disbelief.*\\n\\nstrike two.\\n\\ni consumed what little beer there was, briskly, then ordered another. the second one was poured in exactly the same fashion. now, i\\'m not that guy but the sheer absurdity of the situation demanded i say something. i politely expressed my dissatisfaction and in my wildest dreams i could have never anticipated this response:\\n\\n\"well, we price our beers on fourteen ounce pours and the nitro was turned up high on that one this morning.\"\\n\\nhuh?!?!\\n\\nwhat does that mean?...just deal with it? as if there was nothing wrong with the pour and i just didn\\'t understand their methods. or maybe he was trying to tell me they use fourteen ounce \"pint\" glasses? i don\\'t know. \\n\\nlet\\'s give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that perhaps what he was trying...but unable...to articulate was that a sixteen ounce pour is traditionally fourteen ounces of beer and two ounces of head. i am well aware of this standard, but i clearly got less than fourteen ounces of beer and more than two ounces of head. how does this assertion apply to the guy with a glass of foam in front of him? it doesn\\'t and quite frankly, it was a bizarre thing to say to a customer. as far as the \"nitro being turned up too high\", you can file that under: not my problem. \\n\\nit became abundantly clear it was time to settle up and move along.\\n\\nstrike three. bsbh you\\'re out. \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nif the bartender had reserved his comments and simply corrected his mistake, i would not have left dissatisfied, baffled and annoyed. it defies common sense to serve a patron a glass of foam, let alone two. it\\'s unwise to offer unusual excuses for it and worst of all, the entire episode was insulting to a veteran barfly and beer lover such as myself.\\n\\nany business can impress you or scare you off with one isolated visit, act or event. my experiences over three different visits deteriorated and revealed some significant issues. i\\'m left doubting this place as a dinner destination and doubting the experience level at the bar. the beer list is indeed nice but if its going to be served by careless bartenders, it\\'s all for naught.\\n\\nit could be a striking addition to the neighborhood (operative word: could). maybe one day it will find its rhythm and step up its game...or maybe one day it will change hands and make way for something consistently good that can make better use of the location. let\\'s wait and see. \\n\\nwe have a myriad of equivalent or better options for beer and food in this city so based on my experiences at bsbh i have to say - why bother?\\n\\n*think i\\'m exaggerating about the pour? a pic is posted for your review.\\n\\np.s. - there is nothing remotely cool about that revolving door. it\\'s out of place and borders on the ostentatious.\\nwe were a group of 5 people and waited for an outside table on a beautiful night. we were told it would be a 15 minute wait, but it ended up being a half hour or longer wait. \\nonce we were finally seated, things didn\\'t improve. the outside tables were placed very close together, so you\\'re constantly hitting the person behind you. in addition, the chairs were very uncomfortable.\\nwe ordered food and drinks, and while the drinks arrived fairly quickly, we waited about 45 minutes for food. considering none of us ordered entrees, that seems unreasonably long.  one of the things we ordered was the pretzel with beer cheese, and it was absolutely horrendous. the pretzel was a frozen thing that they didn\\'t bother to heat the whole way through before serving it. the beer cheese dip was 90% beer with a little cheese, just gross. the mac and cheese was a little above kraft quality. \\nbased on long wait for such poor quality food, we will not be returning to this place.\\ni live nearby and was really looking forward to liking this place.\\n\\ngreat location and amazing beer selection.\\n\\ni\\'d really like to give it a good review but the service here is horrid and the food is barely above edible.  \\n\\nseriously.  the food is that bad, and the floor staff is so slow and out of it that it\\'s just impossible to say anything positive about the place other than it\\'s great beer and location.\\n\\n\\nfix the food.  it\\'s really bad\\nthe happy hour is great here. there is a wide variety of beer offered on tap. if you choose to order from bottles or cans, then the selection is even much larger, but not subject to happy hour. i\\'d like to see more philadelphia, pennsylvania, delaware, and nj beers and fewer from the west coast, but those on offer are dependably good. \\nif you have to eat with your beers, stay away from the nachos.  this is a mail-it-in effort that showcases nothing but food service grade items. \\nservice here is a problem. my guest and i sat down at a table with 6 dirty water glasses, four used napkins, and a waiting check to be picked up. we watched a parade of front house staff walk back and forth past our table, with no one stopping to clean it. this included the young woman who had this table in her station. after about 12 minutes she finally took all of the dirty stuff and the check away, and then brought out a spray bottle and dirty rag to clean off the front third of the table, leaving a wet mess where she \"cleaned.\" \\nmy guest\\'s first beer arrived promptly. mine took about another 7 minutes to appear. subsequent beer was brought much more promptly.\\nthe beer program here is predictably the star. the menu looks well thought out, if not entirely well executed. if the front of the house can emphasize the \"service\" aspect to the staff, then the barrel house could possibly see 5 stars.\\nwent here for drinks on numerous occasions. it\\'s a good spot and close to my home. the wait staff is nothing special as i always wish they had more knowledge of their beers and not just \"that one sells a lot\". it\\'s nice that they will give you a taste of a couple beers if you want. now, i don\\'t really need that help much because i usually know my beers, but i like a place to have a knowledgeable waitstaff. \\n\\nthe food here is pretty average. i\\'ve had a couple of the appetizers but nothing has been memorable except the mac and cheese, which is quite delicious.\\n\\nthe bar works well for a beer or drink and i\\'ll keep going back because it\\'s so close, but if i move to a different part of the city, i won\\'t miss it.\\ni\\'ve been here a few times for brunch, dinner, and just drinks and overall i find it a very pleasant place to be. their beer list is extensive and i appreciate how they are all grouped by type. they even make their own ice cream, which is a nice touch.\\n\\ni\\'ve tried the baklava pancakes (yum!) and for dinner i had one of their specials - a chicken cheeseburger which was really juicy! i wasn\\'t expecting that, and was plesantly surprised. i like to recommend this place for anyone who loves beer and tasty bar food.\\na fairly decent locale to visit. the atmosphere itself is pretty generic as well as the menu items, beer list, service, and overall experience. the highlight was a interesting beer menu, seems to be a destination for those who do the tapped app, oh and the delicious smelling peach cobbler candle in the women\\'s bathroom. the service however was a definite low-light, leaving a bit to be desired. after being made to feel like we were standing in the way of an early closing, our 2nd bartender that assisted us after our first one went missing, was kind enough to come over after we waited a bit as she was having her dinner break at a table in the restaurant. she was a bit more helpful, though i still felt like we were bothering her. i totally would have self-served my own beer! overall, it seems like a good 2nd choice place if everything else around it has a wait and you just want a cold beer and a snack.\\nstopped in here for happy hour.  1/2 priced drafts!  \"yes please!\".  what a great deal!!  i had more beers than i had intended to get, but for that price, and decent beer selection, i couldn\\'t resist!  plus, the bartenders were very attentive!  i snacked on some fried pickle spears and the hummus plate.  the pickles were ok, just don\\'t eat them as soon as you get them...otherwise you\\'ll be burned.  literally!  i liked the addition of the artichoke to the hummus, and that you get more than a few pita slices.  i\\'ve been to a couple places that give you a lot of hummus and 2 small pita slices...but thumbs up to barrel house for serving a generous amount of pita that goes along with the generous amount of hummus!  i would recommend coming here for happy hour, it\\'s simply too good of a deal to pass up.\\nmy last visit to bsbh wasn\\'t so great food-wise. the hubby and i went back for their fish fry (because it was so good in the past) and while it wasn\\'t terrible, it was so greasy! the fries, too, weren\\'t as seasoned and good as i recalled. hopefully they\\'ll start paying attention to the food output cause the place wasn\\'t even packed. of course, the beer list was still up to par and the hubby was pleased.\\ni\\'m giving this place 5 stars based on the two times i\\'ve been here so far, the beer list, the service, and the excited feeling i get knowing that it\\'s within walking distance from home. \\n\\nfor dinner, we started with the fried pickles. they were sliced first and then lightly battered and fried to perfection. i\\'m from the south and they usually deep fry a whole spear, so i was pleasantly surprised by this lighter version and so was the hubby. for the entree, i got the curried mussels and the hubby got the fish and chips. my mussels were big, fresh and the broth was seasoned well, although i would\\'ve like to have had more broth. the grilled bread was a nice addition and a standard staple with mussels, so i was glad it wasn\\'t overlooked. the hubby\\'s fish was also lightly battered and fried to perfection, so clearly someone knows what they\\'re doing at the fry station. \\n\\nthe fries deserve a separate paragraph. they are so damn good! i really wanted to try the poutine-style fries (brown gravy, cheese curd & griddled egg), as they have seven variations of fries, but i stuck with stealing ones from the hubbies entree instead. next time though!\\n\\nwe went again for brunch recently and i got the french toast with the griddled egg and bacon- delish! the hubby got the much-talked-about french toast burger and he was pretty pleased also. we split an order of the tempeh hash and at first it was a bit bland (we didn\\'t add ketchup or anything but salt) and then it kinda grew on me; however, i\\'m not likely to order it again. the coffee was great and brunch overall is reasonably priced.\\n\\ni\\'m currently preggo, but i know a good beer list when i see one and the hubby confirms each and every god-forsaken time that the beer is delicious, so i can\\'t wait till this kid is born and i can partake in what is clearly the doings of well-versed beer distributing owner (since he owns bella vista distributor). they have a nitro-tap which usually has the darkest, most delicious choices anywhere you go and that rings true to this place so far, too. i can\\'t wait! \\n\\nspecial note: this place gets packed on the weekends. be forewarned!\\nwent to bistro the other week for happy hour.. saw sign that this place has happy hour too. wanted to check it out today. perfect weather for outdoor seating. however happy hour food was only at bar... that wasn\\'t really a problem to me. i ordered a beer.. nice and refreshing in a chalet glass. the food was a miss for me. ordered mussels in beer. calamari. house salad. the house salad at $5 happy hour special was a little over priced. i liked the dressing but it was kinda small... think side salad size when you get japanese bento box. it was actually best thing i ate... wish a little bit bigger. the mussels although were nice... the beer broth was lacking some depth... i see why the restaurant would feature it with beer instead of traditional white wine. the bread that comes with it was plain bread... add some butter, garlic, or olive oil and grill it. maybe add some garlic in the beer broth or red pepper flakes for some flavor. the calamari was nice and crispy but i think they added some spice to the batter... i couldn\\'t help think indian or middle eastern flavors when i ate it. \\n\\nthe bartender was nice/ friendly and the place was clean. i really wanted to like this place... but i can\\'t help but look past this place and go straight to bistro next door... check out my review for bistro... which i consider one of the best philly restaurants. please note i\\'m not comparing the two restaurants... these are two totally different places... may head back for happy hour drinks.\\ni ended up at bainbridge street barrel house on a friday night with 3 friends after getting dinner at growlers. the drinks we got were all tasty, and the place itself was great. absolutely loved the light fixtures (weird to note, i know, but they really are cool)!\\n\\nbsbh loses a star only for service - the waitress was super nice and helpful, but she seemed a little overwhelmed and took a very long time to come over and take our drink orders. she did say it was her first night, so i forgive her. but to get 5 stars just on drinks, a place has to be absolute perfection. but not be fair, but it\\'s true.\\n\\ni will definitely be back and am looking forward to trying some of their beers on tap, as well as their food. if you\\'re nearby, absolutely stop in for a drink or two!\\ndecent, but has a lot of room for improvement.\\n\\njudging by the menu, decor, and general clientele patronizing this place while i was here, this place is trying to cater to a wide variety of city folk--families with children, older adults, couples, and of course your 20s-30s beer drankin\\' crowd. i think this is a great idea, i just don\\'t know if they have it down quite yet. \\n\\nthey have a long draft list, a huge bottle menu, and some cocktails and wine if beer isn\\'t your thing. for a beer person, however, though the draft list was long, i was not really all that impressed with it, and for the 5 or so beers we ordered from it, i really only liked one of them. of course, the huge bottle list has something for everyone, and though it is a little more expensive than similar lists in the city, is fairly well put together.\\n\\nfood we tried was just ok. i certainly liked the look of the menu, and i\\'ll be looking forward to coming back to try other things from it. the beef chili was lacking in flavor, and the fried pickle chips (i love pickles, it\\'s a little sick), were just too thinly sliced to offer a decent pickle flavor. not bad, but not great either. \\n\\nthe space is lovely, actually a lot larger than i expected, and very open and airy. on a sunday evening we were able to watch the football games comfortably without a huge crowd. the service was great. our bartender may not have been the biggest beer connoisseur but he was very helpful in allowing us to sip and sample a few beers before we found one we really enjoyed. he never left us thirsty, and at the end of his shift he let us know he was leaving just to say bye and thank us for coming. when we asked him if he would like us to close out with him, he said no worries, just wanted to say bye! that kinda friendly service makes me really happy! \\n\\nnot entirely in my neighborhood, but i\\'ll probably be back!\\nstopped in here to grab some dinner and it was fine. i ordered the brussel sprouts which were actually pretty solid and the blackened chicken sandwich. both were average in taste and quality but the drink selection seemed promising for some good beers or whiskies. i would suggest probably sticking with the drinks and apps for quench your cravings.\\nlet\\'s title this post \"dirt salad.\"\\n\\nwe tried this place despite the mediocre yelp ratings because it\\'s nearby and looks appealing from the street.  plus, we thought the slow service issue might be mitigated by going at lunch, when we were the only customers in the place.  no luck.  it still took a surprisingly long time for the good to come out.  \\n\\nmy husband liked his burger but said the fries were only ok.  i ordered the quinoa & arugula salad which looked promising, but every few bites contained grit.  not just little bits, but large grains of sand.  for some reason, i couldn\\'t spot it with my eyes, but the crunching was so loud my husband could hear it.  i was actually afraid i might damage my teeth.  \\n\\ni probably should have sent the salad back, but i was so hungry and they were so slow.  plus, because i have a gluten allergy, there wasn\\'t anything else on the menu for me to order anyway.  a replacement salad might well have been as sandy as the first.\\n\\ni told the (very nice) waiter about the salad being gritty before we left in hopes of sparing future customers\\' teeth.  he did not offer to take it off the bill, but i wasn\\'t really expecting him to.\\n\\ni doubt i\\'ll ever go back.\\ndoes the barrell house do anything fantastic? probably not. do they have a great beer selection? absolutely! is this a place to go with a group of friends to catch up and share some laughs over some appetizers and brews? yes ofcourse. \\n\\nthe waitstaff is friendly the food is decent the drinks are great. but over-all when rating this place its all about the vibe you are looking for going in. i would probably not come here with my girlfriend for dinner or come here when its guys night, but it is nice when there is a good group of people just chilling out for a few too many beers.\\ni really wanted to like the place, but sadly it fell short. the bar itself has a great atmosphere with that gastro pub feel and the beer list was extensive. this is where the positives end. the big issue is the bartenders walking by people 5 or more times before serving a drink. this is almost dirty franks level of bad service. this place needs actual bartenders who want to do their jobs and not ignore you.\\nwe were looking for a place for a quick craft beer after dinner at the nearby silver fork. it was philly beer week and they had a nice selection of brews to choose from. most moderately priced, although one was $14, rare perhaps. bartender was friendly, attentive and helpful.\\nwe would be back.\\nthe server we had was very nice, and went above and beyond to meet my dietary needs (gluten free) with both management and the cook before prepping my meal. the manager came to the table with food suggestions that i could have since they did not have a separate gluten free menu. they took my accommodations very seriously, including cleaning the prep area, not cross-contaminating my ingredients/cookware.  i had a chicken breast with a side of veggies and both were delicious.\\nfirst time here - yes; last time here - hell,no!  really good food & intoxicating drinks, coupled w/great service---thank you john---took a dog-shit-on-your-shoe day and transformed it into mellow.......mmmm\\ncame in for a friends birthday for the $5 sangria. service took awhile but the drinks were pretty good.\\nin spite of several mixed reviews, my friend chris w and i dined at the bainbridge street barrel house.  i was ready to order some highly regarded \"safe\" items, such as the calamari, when our server convinced me to go with the special appetizer of the day, which was bone marrow crostini topped with kim chi.\\n\\ni should\\'ve ordered the calamari. the kim chi overpowered whatever scant bits of bone marrow were on the crostini bread. it was an utter disappointment. it would\\'ve been nicer if they just let me scoop out the bone marrow and omit the kim chi.\\n\\nmy seared duck breast and ginger miso sauce was very good, but the accompanying roasted winter vegetables needed to be cooked more. the presentation resembled a fine stew, so the vegetables need to be cooked more to be consistent with the nicely prepared duck.\\n\\nchris\\' seared sea bass had potential because it was a nice, big piece of chilean sea bass, but it wasn\\'t prepared well. the filet looked and tasted flash fried. it was disappointing since this dish had so much potential.\\n\\nchris was attracted to this place because of its massive beer selection and, quite honestly, it\\'s a fine bar for an eclectic bottle of beer that you can\\'t get anywhere else, but, for food, i recommend going elsewhere.\\nstopped in for lunch today.  what they\\'ve done with the building is impressive.  the eyesore that was there for years with boarded up windows and decaying walls has been transformed into a nice neighborhood place.  \\n\\nwe sat at the bar and ordered food.  the service was great and our food came out fast.  the beer list had more than i would have expected, and some really great choices - i had a local option bourbon kentucky common.  i had a grilled chicken sandwich, which was almost as good as the one around the corner at the latest dish (one of my favorites).  my bf had a fried falafel burger which had great seasoning.  \\ni\\'ll definitely be back soon.\\nservice good, drinks good, fries and sliced lamb sandwich with tziki sauce very good, grilled cheese was overly complicated and failed...some things are best left simple...fried calamari was very light and went well with the spicy sauce it was served with...3 stars for now but am eager to return and try more...just a tip...had a great old fashion here...burbon, bitters, water and sugar...a lot of places leave out the surgar.\\nservice good, drinks good, fries and sliced lamb sandwich with tziki sauce very good, grilled cheese was overly complicated and failed...some things are best left simple...fried calamari was very light and went well with the spicy sauce it was served with...3 stars for now but am eager to return and try more\\nvery good food; excellent beer; crummy service.  i used to go here religiously because i live nearby, but the service has been so poor the last couple times i was there that i cannot allow myself to go back.  been going to competitors like growlers and bridget foy\\'s instead.  last time i was there, two servers walked by me outside for 20 minutes without taking my drink order.  the best food and beer in the world doesn\\'t matter, if the servers are too uncoordinated to bring you any.\\nthis was my first time here and it was a good one. the atmosphere is very cool with the staff very polite and attentive. we sat outside for brunch. the beer selection is excellent. i had the \"fonzie\" burger which has proscuitto on it it was done expertly with a great taste. the fries were good as well. my friend had the lamb sausage hash which he described as some of the best hash he ever had. i don\\'t give allot of four stars out but this place is worth it and i would recommend checking it out if you are in the queens village section of philly.\\ni love the location and the overall look of bainbridge street. some of the staff can be quite friendly. sadly, the slow service and hit or miss meals cause me to give them a \"meh, i\\'ve experienced better\"....way better.\\n\\nmost recently visited yesterday for a brunch/beer event that we knew would draw an early crowd. no doubt in my mind they did too, yet the were so unorganized from the start. they open at 10am, yet we are standing outside until just about 10:30 while they attempt to get their act together. finally, they let the masses inside. at 10am, it was 25 people...get us in, but nope. they wait and let the line build up to almost 50 and when we sit at the bar, the bartender yells out \"everyone please be patient, as we just let in about 75 people!\".\\nif you would have let us in when you open, you would have been able to breeze thru the 1st wave and be ready for the 2nd, but you waited so everyone was chomping at the bit for service and with good reason.\\n\\ni order a coffee stout from a fl brewery new to philly beer week and she brings me an ipa. swing and a miss the very first chance to make things better. she was quick to correct things, thankfully. our bartender did a nice job keeping our glasses filled and taking our order fairly quick. we waited about 30 minutes for our meal. i ordered the sausage hash and it was two beautiful sunny side up eggs on top of a bowl of cubed potatoes (just slightly undercooked) with a few small bits of jalapeno and the sausage was (no joke) cut up sausage links...the tiny ones and maybe one or two links. we\\'re talking jimmy dean, scrawny links of sausage. like no other hash i have ever had. not the worst tasting thing, but it was a bowl of potatoes. $11.\\n\\ni come here a couple times a year and the draft list alone will bring me back, but they need to work on the meals big time and the floor management has no presence in the place, they are always understaffed and too many people look pissed off dining in the joint.\\nour go to local bar!! my boyfriend & i love it here. we typically always sit at the bar & have great service. beers are always rotating & have a great selection.  food is good too. nothing crazy but good fresh bar type food with some healthier options thrown in there if you are into them - which i am! check it out, you won\\'t be disappointed.\\nas regulars to bsbh, we are looking for a new local spot. so disappointed with our past 2 visits. three weeks ago, brunch took 1 hour for food to arrive. today, we stopped in at 2pm for beers & snacks. knowing they offer a snack menu at 3, i waited for the tator tots (which i love), only to be told at 2.58pm that the kitchen worked too hard during brunch & is not cooking for the mid-day. what a waste. do yourself a favor & head to a better run establishment. food is good, beers are good. but the way they run the joint is by far suffering.\\ni\\'ve been here a handful of times for the great beers but i just recently ate here and the food was good. it\\'s a nice bar and service is always good. \\n\\nfor dinner my friend and i shared a few things. chicken wings- eh.. neither good nor bad. just whatever. fried pickles- awesome! highly recommend these. and the sally smothers burger. yumm. it was slightly cooked over our desired temperature but it was still delicious. it\\'s topped with a fried egg, pancetta and fried shallots! \\n\\nawesome beer bar too\\nmy first experience at the bsbh was very positive.  on their second night, i felt that all their cylinders were firing and they made everyone very happy.  the kitchen was flying and the drinks flowed effortlessly.  all the staff seemed to be up to speed and knew how to take care of the customers.\\n\\nwe arrived to a packed bar.  it being election night, all eyes were focused on the televisions showing the results.  the music was at a good volume to let you know you were out somewhere but still able to have casual conversation.\\n\\nfirst up were the fried pickles and wow were they good.  the pickles were sliced into medallions, coated in an ipa batter and fried perfectly.  the accompanying dipping sauce kept the dish light and fresh.\\n\\nthe grilled octopus was really tasty and my only gripe was that i wanted more of it.  the texture and flavor of it was perfect and i believe it was resting on a sweet potato puree.  the standout for me was the lamb liver terrine.  it had the organ taste but it wasn\\'t overwhelming.  garnishing it with capers brought just the right amount of salt to the party.\\n\\nthe space is really nice.  their is ample seating at both the bar and the surrounding tables.  i think the bainbridge street barrel house really hit the ground running and it\\'s a great addition to our neighborhood.\\nunfortunately i didn\\'t get a chance to try the food, but they have a great beer list and an even greater happy hour  (half price drafts). wonderful outdoor seating, good serving staff. great experience, i\\'ll definitely be back\\nlove this place! mellow atmosphere, farm to table veggies, great draft list and ciders!\\nok i finally have to review this place because of repeatedly terrible service. we walked out today before anyone even came over to give us water. must have been over ten minutes of just sitting and no one acknowledged us. we went down the street to bar/restaurant that trains its employees how to wait on tables. will never come back as this must have been the fifth time we\\'ve had the slowest and worst service i\\'ve experienced in a while. food is only ok, so it\\'s definitely not worth the lack of service.\\nprobably the best beer & bourbon list in the city. great food too. i had the grilled octopus, and the pizza two ways.\\nit\\'s with sadness that i have to write a non-excellent review. i want to like this place a lot, pretty solid atmosphere and set up, great location, big and nice windows. but a lot of stupid and unnecessary crap went wrong - they never gave us silverware, there wasn\\'t soap in the bathroom the entire time (went when first got there then before i left - never refilled), the open kitchen set up only works if the cooks don\\'t create smoke every 10 minutes that wafts through dining room, and finally, they were out of half the entrees! yes, out of 6 entrees they were out of half of them, that seems pretty ridiculous. \\n\\nthey also skimped on fish and chips portion.  \\n\\ni commend them for including a survey with the check, i gave honest and fair feedback and hope they listen to it. \\n\\nthe place needs to get better or die trying.\\nbeer selection here is always great. there is a lot of variety and they often have rarer beers on draft. i like the atmosphere, it\\'s a very chill and spacious neighborhood bar, with friendly service. great for sitting at the bar and watching eagles games or playing quizzo or sitting outside. i\\'ve really enjoyed their burger and pulled pork sandwich, and the other stuff looks great too.\\ngreat for craft beer selection. friendly service. food took way too long, as i saw with other people\\'s complaints. our burger and pulled pork sandwich were both very dry and tasteless. bacon looked like wawa bacon. stop in for a good beer, go elsewhere for dinner.\\ngreat beer selection but they don\\'t always have the ones they list.  but skip the food. who could mess up a grilled cheese and soup combo.  bainbridge street barrel house managed to do just that.  ice cold cheese sandwich and vegetable noodle soup that looked more like a bowl of overcooked pasta with no soup and no vegetables.  i wanted to like this place but at a near empty lunch service, it was horrible.\\ni have been to bainbridge street barrel house a few times now and i never had a bad experience there. they have a pretty good beer selection, i tried their late dinner menu with a hummus platter  and tried their brunch with a french toast burger with bacon.  bot were very tasty and there was plenty to eat! the service was very good and i think the prices are in line with where they should be. i will definitely go back to this place.\\none word, porkenstein! what a fantastic sandwich . ground pork patty, with pulled pork pork belly and ham and cheese, does not get any better than this, come hungry. stopped by for lunch last week and only a few other people were there but i sat at the bar and was served by a very knowledgeable and friendly bartender who knew his beers and allowed me to try samples when i had a question. will definitely come back for great food and service\\ndecent bar with a good beer selection. their food is good, not great. i have had both decent and very poor service here. my rating would definitely be 4 stars if they could just get their wait staff together. often, in larger groups, they ask one person at a time \"can i get you anything\" then walk away before asking or before you can flag them down to let them know that you would also like something.\\ngo for beer, but the wait for food is always too long. every time i\\'ve been here they\\'ve been understaffed (including on nye). exhausted waitstaff is always trying really hard to deliver good service, but the food always takes forever, particularly for brunch. once the food comes it\\'s pretty decent, but hard to enjoy after a 45 minute wait. the draft list is good, and changes frequently so i would recommend it for beer. it also has outdoor seating, which we only had to wait at the bar for 10 minutes for on a sunday afternoon.\\nfive stars to the beer selection; three to the food.\\n\\nbainbridge is nowhere near my apartment, but i find myself there fairly often thanks to their outstanding beer list. there\\'s really something for every beer drinker here, and their menu is extensive. their events/tap takeovers are usually fantastic, too. recently, they had a bunch of almanacs on for their birthday, and that was just absolutely phenomenal.\\n\\nas for the food, i\\'ve yet to try anything that has been all too memorable. mac and cheese was kinda bland, the nachos were just okay and the grilled chicken (i forget the name!) sandwich wasn\\'t my favorite.\\n\\nnonetheless, you need to stop in for the beer. i\\'m sure i\\'ll be back soon as well!\\ni came here with friends intent on trying a bunch of different types of whiskey. unfortunately, although they have a very extensive whiskey list, they were out of quite a few things. no rebellion, no kilbeggan, so i went with my third choice of dad\\'s hat, which was actually very good. they would be an excellent bar if they actually had the stock they advertise.\\n\\ni ordered the beer battered pickles and tried a piece of my friend\\'s calamari. both were delicious, generous portions for the price, and went well with whiskey. they were also very accommodating in terms of seating our group of five and being open to adding more tables because we didn\\'t know how many people were going to show up. there was a live band that was loud enough to enjoy but not so loud that we couldn\\'t have a conversation. overall it was a very enjoyable experience with good food, good friends, and of course good whiskey.\\nit seems that there is a real black/white split on opinions of bsbh, but i\\'m going with the positive side feeling like i can give my two cents now having visited numerous times in the last two months. to those that complained about the long wait for tables in the first week of busininess operation: well, it\\'s a brand spankin\\' new joint in an area known for other great eateries, obviously there is going to be a wait. sorry you didn\\'t get a table, that\\'s what happens when a place is doing big business. maybe i\\'m wrong, but if you didn\\'t stick around to try the food, have a beer, or visit once the hype settled down to see what this place is really about then you don\\'t have a basis for judgement.\\n\\nafter quite a few nights at the bar just oggling the beer menu and dabbling here and there in a few apps plus a brunch club meetup, i\\'m going to stick with a healthy 4 stars. the fried pickles are pretty awesome, the calamari is up there as well,..paired with one of their many unique rotating drafts and barrel aged beers, sometimes just sitting at the bar is enough. big tv\\'s, knowledgable bartenders, and a view into the kitchen keeps things nice and casual while the other side of the house has your more traditional restaurant style seating.\\n\\nat brunch club, we were asked how many would be in our party and i told the hostess between 6-8 and we were given a set of high top tables on the bar side of the house toward the 6th st. windows. my bloody mary that morning was really excellent with quite a spice kick to it, just the way i like it...other orders included champagne cocktails and beers. orders for brunch around the table ranged from waffles to mac and cheese to my smoked salmon bagel. everyone seemed to enjoy their meals, my salmon was a little \"meh\" not exactly those thin larger slices of fish mroe like smaller pieces that i needed to piece together on my bagel like a puzzle, but the fact that the bagel was made in house and was actually fairly decent (for a philly bagel) made up for it. service was a little \"off\", our waiter forgot to take one entire meal order as he walked away from the table and we had to flag him back, but what happened a few moments later is what sealed for me the 4-star rating.\\n\\nthe last two of our party arrived shortly after ordering (assuming they were not going to show up) and it was a friend of mine with her 7 year old son. the hostess came over and told me that we could not have her son with us at the table because we were seated in the \"bar half\" of the restaurant. i took one look around the full restaurant and asked if there was anywhere else where we could sit. she said unfortunately not and that we could wait for another table (mind you, the rest of us had already ordered); my friend said \"it\\'s ok, we\\'ll leave\"...now obviously i\\'m in a bad spot because i don\\'t want her leaving, maybe i should have mentioned the child when we got our table initally (it didn\\'t dawn on me that this would be an issue), and the restaurant couldn\\'t really cancel the orders we had placed 15 minutes prior. the owner came over and told us the policy, that it was not just his policy but a hard law, he then told us that we could stay...no one shouldered blame for the minor hiccup, but he really went on a limb to allow us the seats.\\n\\ni like that i can add another local spot to my list of those that allow me the one block walk home after a night of boozing and one that offers a reasonably priced brunch with friendly accomodating staff.\\nstopped by for lunch a week or so before christmas.  it was the first time i had made the trip to the barrel house even though i had wanted to stop by for a while.  the place is clean and decorated in the new wave urban beer bar style.  \\n\\nthe food was good, my wife had a burger which was a little over the top which made it difficult to eat.  i had the falafel burger which was solid.  the fries were excellent and probably the best part of the meal.  \\n\\nthe beer selection is very good even by philadelphia standards.  it took them a while to figure out their happy hour but i was told its half off drafts 4:30-6:30.  i\\'m not a big fan of happy hours that start at 4:30 but half off drafts is a nice happy hour, especially when you have a good selection.  \\n\\nthe service was ok.  i think there was only one other group in the restaurant when we were there.  we sat at the bar.  the bartender wasn\\'t overly chatty and the tv in front of us was playing an infomertial the whole time.  i guess i could have asked for them to change the channel but they probably should have done on their own.  \\n\\noverall its a nice place and i\\'ll stop by again.  the menu is simple and the food was decent.\\ni\\'ve been here countless times since i wrote my last review and i still think this place is pretty worthy of four stars.  they have a seemingly endless amount of beers here and the food hits the spot for me.  i love some of the vegan choices they have on the menu (tempeh and quinoa dishes, amongst others), but make no mistake: their burgers are great, too.  i appreciate the events they do here (sour night, hop night, etc.) and they do offer happy hour specials and deals on yelp.  i will admit that the service can be a little hit-or-miss depending on who you get, so hopefully that will improve as time goes on.  i find that sitting at the bar versus a table seems to help with this because the bartenders are more efficient than the waiters.  i\\'m definitely a fan and i really hope this place doesn\\'t go anywhere anytime soon; i\\'d really hate to see it close and have nothing here.\\ni have to say, the reviews i\\'ve been reading about bainbridge street barrel house are surprising to me.  to each their own, dear yelpers, but i must respectfully disagree with those who are giving three stars or under.\\n\\ni\\'ve been to bsbh a few times now and each time has been a great experience for me.  the first time was just for drinks.  they really do have quite the beer selection and their bartenders are competent making suggestions.  the second time we stopped in for dinner and i stuffed myself with their falafel burger.  falafel can dry out very easily, but the chef didn\\'t overcook it, so saying that it was pretty freaking delicious is an understatement.  the fries that came with it were well seasoned and we also grabbed a dish of the brussels sprouts, which i thoroughly enjoyed.  my most recent visit here involved brunch last weekend.  i went with the vegan tempeh hash.  it was rounded out with jalapenos and had a really cool kick to it.  it filled me up well.  i didn\\'t leave wishing i had gotten anything extra and i wasn\\'t hungry an hour later. \\n\\nbsbh isn\\'t perfect, but they\\'re in young grasshopper mode at this point.  i think the service is still a little spotty, but they\\'ve been open for what, less than a month?  so i think i can be a little lenient about that while they figure out the most efficient system that will work for them.  they\\'re on their way to becoming something really great and i\\'m honestly happy to see them in the neighborhood.  i will definitely be back here for both food and drinks and i can\\'t recommend them enough.\\nwe were three and planned to eat and drink.  upon arrival, i checked in on yelp and was told that bainbridge st barrel house was offering me a 50% discount on a beverage.  the staff refused to make good with this offer.  \\nso yes, bsbh lied to yelp, saying they would make good on this offer to customers, but it is a lie.\\nthis is why bainbridge street barrel house can suck it...\\n\\nthey planned an event that just happened to fall on the eve of my husband\\'s birthday. it happened to be a sour beers event. we happen to love sour beers. we happened to be on a crazy low carb/no beer diet for almost three weeks before the event so we were stoked for our favorite beers and birthday celebrations. \\n\\nwe arrived with tons of people at 7pm, the time the event was supposed to start. i\\'m not sure who planned this event, but they did it wrong. they served different beers all day and thought it a great idea to change all of their taps at the start of the event. uh, what? so that was one of their gigantic mistakes. the next happened when apparently their pos system went down, which apparently means you just completely ignore your packed restaurant and offer zero communication with any of your patrons. last time i checked bars and restaurants existed before computers. figure it out. \\n\\nsome of our friends had arrived before us and it took almost an hour to even get a server to come and talk to us. mind you, at this point they were still seating people. after 25 minutes of us waiting, 45 for a friend who\\'d arrived earlier, we finally ordered beers. our server wrote them down on a piece of paper, see no computer. awesome. nope! my first clue should have been that he was not versed in these beers, at all. seriously? did you train your employees for a special event? maybe have a tasting? maybe hire people who are into beer, or who can at least pretend to be? but i digress...25 minutes later we still had no effing beer. we were then apologized to and given the pos explanation again. no, not good enough, especially when you are still seating people. especially when i go home and see that on facebook during the height of your problems you took the time to update your status encouraging more people to come to your establishment. you have time to update a status during that sort of crisis? i\\'ve lost all respect for you barrel house, it\\'s like you were tweeting during your sats. \\n\\nthere are so many different ways that night could have been handled, it was just like someone gave up even trying. instead of celebrating with sour beers and happiness we salvaged our night by getting pizza and beers down the street. super annoying since we made the trek south and could\\'ve just stayed in our neighborhood and had a good experience. blah. first impressions...\\nlike bill g, i will give this a \"hopeful 4.\"  despite the other reviews, we were very impressed with how the waitstaff handled the mob scene that was the second weekend of the restaurants opening.  there were some opening weekend glitches, namely, they were out of several of the beers on the menu.  despite having to settle for third choice beers, we were very happy with the burgers.  i have to say, the decor just doesn\\'t seem to fit the neighborhood or the menu - felt more like a chain restaurant than a local beer/burger place.\\ni went to bainbridge street barrel house on a tuesday night with friends for quizzo and we had a great time! the atmosphere was light and comfortable, everything you\\'d want from a tuesday trivia night. \\n\\nthere is a huge drink (especially beer) menu and the drinks were reasonably priced/cheap. while i didn\\'t eat anything, i was pleasantly surprised to see the menu labeled their vegan and vegeterian options which looked pretty good i might add! the food was definitely pricier than i\\'d anticipate for an establishment like this. that said, i\\'d definitely come back to try out some of their vegan options.\\n\\nthe only hiccup (if you could even call it that) was that a few of my friends and i ordered original sin pear ciders, but they gave us ace pear ciders without calling attention to the switch. that felt a little weird, but not a huge deal. our waitress was otherwise really friendly so no complaints there either!\\ncame here for quizzo on a tuesday and it was yum! i started with the squash fries with jalepeno aioli for $5 - they were pretty yummy plus i felt like i was being healthier since they were squash ;). they kind of tasted like jalepeno poppers due to the aioli and that\\'s what they made them delicious (alone, they were a bit bland).\\n\\nwhat i loved and would come back here for were the chipotle wings! omg they were delicious! amazing sauce. the blue cheese was super thick and chunky so i had a kind of hard time scooping it up (not exactly a \"dipping\" sauce) but it was still pretty amazing so i would definitely order them again. \\n\\nthe quizzo was fun (about 8-10 pm tuesday nights) - various rounds like music, trivia, lightening, etc. apparently they are having a \"star wars\" themed quizzo next week so seems like they keep things mixed up! \\n\\nalso, the ambiance is cool and the place its on a cute street corner - nice area for a stroll and close to south street so lots of stuff to see and do.\\n\\nrecommended.\\nthe chicken sandwich is the best chicken sandwich i\\'ve ever had. my friend and i have had it multiple times and it\\'s amazing. dark meat so it\\'s juicy, fontina cheese, caramelized onions, avocado and an amazing aioli sauce. it\\'s full of flavor and each is complimentary and a perfect combo. my boyfriend got the pulled pork and said it was really good as well. nice atmosphere, good beer list. excited to try other entrees so i can comment on the restaurant as a whole but so far so good and i continue to go back.\\ni have such high hopes for this place, i really do. the beer menu is just outstanding but i have yet to have a good meal there. brunch, lunch, and dinner. i will continue to go here for their beer, but that\\'s it. the food is consistently undercooked, and the ticket times are just unacceptable, even if they\\'re not busy. i keep hoping they will get adequate staff, but my hopes haven\\'t been met.\\nmoved out of the neighborhood recently, and it was nice to come back for a visit.  stopped in here with a few girls for happy hour.  the place was crowded on a friday night, but the service was pretty good, we sat at the bar, staff was friendly.  great beer  list.\\ni knew i was in trouble when i asked the bartender whether a \"medium\" burger would still be pink in the middle.  \"oh, this isn\\'t tgifriday\\'s, we have good cooks.\"  um, thanks bud.  so i went with medium, but should have just went with a different meal instead.  the $12 \"burger\" was two \"bubba-burger\"-esque  patties, super dry with some chopped up pickles.  the roll was like a large english muffin, also dry, and not a good look.  i am not a picky eater, and this burger was just so disappointing.  it made me want to go to the royal after just to compensate with a real burger.   side salad i got with the burger was fine.  fried pickles were as someone as stated, too thin so no pickle flavor.\\nrecently went there for brunch one saturday and the place was empty except for us.  granted, we were having a late brunch - but breakfast in the afternoon was our plan.  there were five of us and we were seated right away.  we ordered a few drinks and were pleased with the extensive beer list.  however, apparently they keep their stock low of some of the less popular bottles.  one of my friends asked if she could have a certain beer - the server returned about 5-10 minutes later and said they were out of that beer and asked her to pick another - out of that one as well.  this makes for a challenging experience.\\n\\nthe food is actually very good.  i gave it two stars simply because of the title being out of line with them being unaware of the varieties they are out of stock.  for brunch, i had the typical western omelette which was a sizable portion and came with home fries, toast and fresh fruit.  they understand we could have gone to a diner so they give high-class restaurant quality in diner-size portions.  they were in the holiday spirit and had pumpkin french toast - admittedly you would probably not be disappointed if you ordered that.\\n\\nif you\\'re not at barrel house to drink, then i recommend going for a coke and brunch.  but if you\\'re wanting to drink without a wait to find a beer that\\'s in-stock, might be best to go elsewhere.\\nnothing spectacular. ordered old fashioned, and it was sub par.  did not order food, only drinks.\\nthe food is just not good.  all the people in my party agreed that their meals (grilled romaine salad, pulled pork sandwich, and short rib tacos) were essentially tasteless.  short rib tacos were not impressive looking and the side salad was drenched in dressing.  the pulled pork sandwich looked reasonable, but the eater said it wasn\\'t anything to write home about.  i had the grilled romaine salad, and it was a measly amount of romaine, with finely shredded cheese that probably comes in bulk in a ziploc bag.  artichokes weren\\'t bad, a little too vinegary.  i\\'m still starving after that \"meal\".\\n\\nwe had gone there for lunch the first week it opened, and the food was way better that time.  also, they took the wings off the menu that were the reason we went back today.  not sure if the chef quit or what, but they need to change it back.\\n\\ni wish there was a \"vibratey\" option for the noise level in the survey questions.  there is something under the floor that just vibrates and vibrates the entire time.  very annoying.  also annoying?  when you don\\'t tell patrons that it\\'s pepsi, not coke.  to some people there is a difference.  a lot of places do this though, so nothing against this place.\\n\\nbah.\\nwe ordered a $10 pizza which was essentially some cheese and crap thrown on a tortilla, a big quinoa salad which had walnuts that tasted pretty stale and some wings that were mediocre. \\n\\ndessert was meh. \\n\\nwould probably not come back.\\ni enjoyed every bit of my experience here. \\n\\nthis is a fantastic place for crafts brews and great food. i love the red brick and lamps on the exterior, as well as the unique lighting on the inside that compliments the dark wood furniture, creating a cozy atmosphere. the beer list here displays options for every palate. being a belgian wheat fan myself, i chose two i\\'ve never had before: clown shoes clementine and southampton double white. both were exceptional; fragrant with citrus and crisp in bite. \\n\\nas for food, everyone i came with was more than satisfied with their choices. for appetizers we shared the lamb sausage, brussel sprouts, and mussels. each dish was bursting with flavor. the lamb sausage was tender and juicy. the brussel sprouts were roasted to perfection,  and the tangy apple and nutty almond accompanied them beautifully. the mussels were plump and juicy, drowning in a delicious curried beer sauce. i would recommend all of these choices and would definitely order each of them again. yum!\\n\\nafter two delectable courses, one would be silly not to sample the sweet confections and end the meal right. we ordered the cheesecake, apple pocket and olive oil cake. the cheesecake was good... fluffy, yet creamy..pretty standard goodness for a well made cheesecake. the apple pocket was like a dumpling. it was flaky on the outside, but full of chopped up warm apples and sweetness on the inside. vanilla ice cream complimented it wonderfully. i was very delighted with what i ordered though: the olive oil cake. i had heard of it before, but never tried it. it almost reminded me of a pound cake as it was golden brown on the outside, but moist on the inside. they paired it with salted caramel ice cream and pistachios. \\n\\ni definitely plan on visiting here again. there are more craft beers and many food options on the menu that i can\\'t consume in just one visit! :)\\nwork to be done here..... brunch service 45 minutes from order to table.  i felt terrible for the waitress who kept us informed.  why we were there two tables complaining.  one table left before thier food came.  the food was ok.  portions average but not served hot only warm.  the table next to us asked for the manager, he never came.  he almost cowered at the front.  not customer friendly.  so much room for improvement, beautiful space, great location.  just need better kitchen staff.  had chicken and waffles.  waffles were a tad on the rubber side possible seemed microwaved.  waitress older gal... highly gracious.  i felt deeply bad for her.\\nforgot how the food tastes.   just know it wasn\\'t terrible.  but love the vibe bc it\\'s busy and outdoor seating and wide open windows.\\nhappy that they confirmed via our twitter account that the pat lafrieda brisket blends they carry are from creekstone.  with that said i was a little disappointed in the burger, the patty was great but toppings, sauce, and bun needed to be better.  their sweet potato fries were very good though.  seating outside is good for families with kids. \\n\\nnote that their mustard contains alcohol so ask before leaving it on.\\ni went here soon after it opened with my fiance and liked the calamari but the drinks were overpriced ($15+ for a margarita!) but i decided to give it another try since it was very new . . .\\n\\ni went here last week with a friend. the manager/owner came over and assisted with an issue with our order but the server was slow and they charged me $25 for each  margarita this time. when i inquired they removed $10 but that\\'s not acceptable and i will never come here again.\\ni\\'d wanted to go here for a while, ever since tapestry closed, and we finally made it out before dinner on a thursday.  the happy hour deal was one of the better ones in philly, with half off all drafts from 430 to 630, and the beer selection was solid. my wife, who is not a beer drinker, loved the various house infused cocktails. \\n\\nthe space is perfect for hanging out and definitely has the room to accommodate larger groups of people for happy hour. we will be back often.\\nclean and comfortable neighborhood bar. free wifi and plenty of counter space at the bar make this one of our fave working date night spots. have work to do after hours? might as well have a beer in hand with your loved one and commiserate together! :)\\n\\ngood:\\n- beer: great, diverse selection of many varietals.\\n- hh: m-f 430-630p half off drafts unless indicated\\n- food: why i can\\'t lose the last 5 pounds\\n   - hh: fried pickles. make sure they\\'re the slivers.\\n   - hh: brussel sprouts. they\\'re healthy, dangit!\\n   - brunch: french. toast. burger. high-cal ambrosia.\\n   - etc: sally smothers. pancetta, egg, beefy yum.\\n\\neh:\\n- service can vary. we have experiencex both great and poor service, but the latter tends to happen when it\\'s busy (ahem, beer week events).\\n- slight hipster feel.\\n- lots of kids on weekends. however - props to the  parents for braving dining out with kids ... (and special mad props to the parents who reason with/discipline rowdy kids instead of just letting them cry and whine and disturb other patrons - i salute your fortitude)\\nfavorite restaurant in queens village, hands down! beer selection is great, fun atmosphere, and amazing food. i\\'m also very excited they have now been approved for outdoor seating, and will plan to venture here a lot during the summer.\\nthis place has bar-none the best stuffed grape leaves i have ever eaten.  they are fresh, rather than the standard soggy-and-soaked-in-olive-oil that you find in every other greek salad, so you can actually rip through the leaf like you\\'re eating real food!  and they are stuffed with a delicious combination of quinoa and goat-cheese.   give me a whole plate of these and i\\'ll die happy!!!\\n\\nthat being said, the hummus that came with the mezze plate could have been flavored a little better.  it lacked some salt and garlic.  and the olives were ok but pretty standard canned greek olives.  they came without pits, so that was nice.\\n\\nthe mac and cheese was delicious too, but it\\'s mac ad cheese.  you have to work to screw that up.  \\n\\n\\nso all in all, this is a nice place but definitely not one i\\'d be screaming at my friends to go to next time, unless i am craving an entire plate of those grape leaves again (which seems likely).  good beer selection.  \\n\\nin all:  good choice if you\\'re in the area, and great outdoor seating!\\nthey have breakfast burritos on the weekend until 3! the burrito itself is fine -- lots of soft scrambled egg, sautÃ©ed onion and red pepper, chopped tomato, and some cheese and beans mixed in. it\\'s topped with guacamole and sour cream, with cubes of seasoned potatoes on the side. i would have appreciated if the potatoes were crispy, the inside of the burrito was less wet, and if the toppings came on the side and included a salsa.\\nhaving been here four times since opening day, i figured it\\'s time to write up a nice review of the place.  the first two times i went in were for drinks (opening night and one other time) ... this was before they had implemented a happy hour.  prices were fair and food wasn\\'t bad, but i was disappointed both times due to the fact that many of the beers they had listed on their vast beer menu were not in stock.  since it was within the first week or two of their opening, i figured it was just something to chalk up to a new business getting up and running.\\n\\nthe third time i went in was for dinner on a friday evening.  we got seated immediately, despite the fact that the place was packed.  the food was pretty good (i had a quinoa salad and my date had the burger), but the service was lacking.  the waitress brought the wrong beers, our food and drink orders took a really long time to get, and when we actually did need something from the waitress, she was nowhere to be found.\\n\\nmy fourth and most recent visit was for their newly instituted happy hour -- one of the best in the city, in my opinion.  they offer half off (yes, 50% off) all draft beers (except whatever is in cask) for two hours, which is really an amazing deal.  since their draft list is always changing and boasts about 15-20 options, you\\'re really getting an opportunity to try out some of the more interesting (and pricey) beers for half off.  i mean, my friend tried an $11 beer for $5.50!  this last visit was the best one so far -- they seem to have more of the kinks worked out now.\\n\\ni\\'d definitely recommend this place for hh and to try out some really different beers.\\nlet me start off by saying if i was just there to drink i would have given an extra star. great beer selection though a little pricey. i liked the atmosphere and the feel of the place and loved the mason jar lights.\\n\\ni should have known when there was no one in the place except for 1 or 2 people at the bar that this was a  bad decision but we gave it a shot. we were going to order sandwiches but went for the apps instead to share. we ordered the wings, mac and cheese and chili. these are 3 foods i think would be hard to mess up in a bar scene but i was wrong. i will say the chili was good. it could have been that the wings were so bad that i was just enjoying the chili so much. regardless, i would get it again. the wings, terrible. even came with a complimentary piece of hair! whatever sauce they put on them should be changed. i hate when people try to make simple bar food fancy and screw it up. and whatever the sauce was to the equivalent of blue cheese, yikes! the mac and cheese...what it seemed like was they took a microwave pack of easy mac, added some more cheese then crumbled \"goldfish and pretzels\" as they said. wouldn\\'t put it in my top 100 mac and cheese places that\\'s for sure. save your money and go somewhere else! food needs some help but this place has the potential to be good if they can get it right.\\ngreat selection of rotating beers, you can always find something new and interesting to try! good food, variety of cuisine options. love the slaw that a lot of the dishes are served with. outdoor seating available! only sad they got rid of the fried pickles :(\\ni almost didn\\'t want to write a review for this place because i don\\'t want to make it crazy to be able to get a seat at, but here goes. the happy hour at this place is amazing. 1/2 price on almost all the draft beers. yesterday, they had about 25 different pumpkin options, which for me is heaven! the food was also incredibly delicious. my roommate ordered a burger and then worried she wouldn\\'t be able to eat the whole thing. by the time i looked over to ask for a bit...it was gone! it was just that good! i also recommend the fried pickles! i will be back here as soon as i can be!!\\nwent for happy hour and wasn\\'t disappointed!\\n\\npretty spacious interior. i was awkwardly seated next to a large pillar but i suppose that\\'s my own fault. a nice list of drafts that were all half off. many good selections, better than most happy hours around center city. also had a small list of food items that were specially priced for happy hour as well. i had the salmon toast which was delicious. a decent serving of food and very well presented. also might have almost been healthy? \\n\\nwasn\\'t too crowded until the crowd started to show up for trivia night which i hear is fun there. waitress was attentive, wasn\\'t too loud. not much else to it. just a good happy hour experience.\\nat first it was great. but we waited over 90 minutes for our food on a sunday night...the bar was empty. at no point did anyone apologize or say anything about the wait. after that, two of our party ordered fish and it was inedible. trust me, our group is not one that is particular and that was not acceptable. would not go back. even if i was paid.\\nservice slow.  food sucked.  wouldn\\'t go back\\nbainbridge street barrel house has one of the best tap rotations in philly.  the happy hour features half price drafts and apps.\\ni don\\'t give bad reviews and i don\\'t think this will be one either. i just wish this place was better. there\\'s nothing wrong with it, but the food is just not great. it\\'s good. the burgers are fine. it\\'s just that nothing blows me away about bbh. the place itself is nice and very clean. the staff is nice and they work hard. no beer on tap, which is odd. the bottle menu is extensive and expensive. i\\'ll still go back over and over again since it\\'s a good spot for a drink or two or to watch a game and grab some wings. i just think a revamped menu would do this place a lot of good. the reviews on here seem to be on point and go with the overall feeling people in the neighborhood have about bbh.\\nvery nice selection of whiskey and beer. the staff recommended a great beer. had the sally smothers burger-delicious! they also have a creative selection of homemade ice cream. everyone was cool and friendly and the food and atmosphere were fantastic.\\nstopped here for a drink because it was the closest place with outdoor seating (our puppy was getting tired). \\n\\ngreat location, extremely friendly staff, and decent food. \\n\\ni got the ozzie (veggie burger) which came on pita with a srichira \"mayo\", which was actually ground cauliflower. the veggie burger was pretty good and my boyfriend was happy with his chicken sandwich. i wouldn\\'t come back here to eat, but the drinks and a comfortable / laid back ambience would draw me in again!\\ni really was happy that they rehabbed the old building and was hoping for a good place.  in short, service is painfully slow, food is bad, however windows are nice.  the fries that came with my pork sandwich were horrible, dried out and good chance that they were from a frozen bag of fries from acme.  the pork sandwich wasn\\'t bad but no one would eat it again.  we made the mistake of ordering dessert;  homemade ice-cream or turkey hill vanilla?   i did not try the beer and maybe that is really really good?   however, i will never know because i can\\'t imagine going back in.  enjoy!\\nthe biscuits and gravy was absolutely delicious! sadly, i think we visited on a day where there was only one waitress. we had to wait an absolutely ridiculous amount of time. the first plate was brought to our table 30 minutes before the last table arrived. \\n\\nbloody marys: 5/10. they tasted like they were out of a mix bottle with no spice, just really red, bad tomato juice.\\ni\\'ve been here a bunch of times and it is definitely becoming my neighborhood go-to. i love the amount/versatility of beers on tap, as well as the food here. i have been here and eaten a few times at tables both inside and outside, but my favorite spot will always be at the bar chatting with the bartender and sipping on a few great new beers.\\ni love this place. went for drag bingo and had an amazing time. awesome drinks and great environment. beautiful decor and very friendly and attentive waitresses. i also really appreciate how engaged the owner was, really making sure patrons were enjoying themselves.\\nthis review is biased  because we sat outside on a beautiful day and my dog was behaving for once. wife had the veggie burger and i had the mezze board. everything was really good. lots of beer choices as well.\\nthe best over-medium eggs, potatoes and fruit for brunch, all for a reasonable price!\\ni can only vouch for the beers- didn\\'t have time to grab a bite. \\ncame here for a mid day drink before work. sat myself and bartender was very friendly and accommodating in letting me taste test a few of the beers on the extensive list. pricing on brews is typical, 6-8 dollars. maybe it was just the people on staff today but my bartender was attentive and knowledgable. i admit i was worried from some other reviews but service was good. \\nmy only personal con - no wheat beers on tap and only one saison? it\\'s summer! and i\\'m partial, myself. but a diverse list regardless. \\nif you\\'re in the area mid day and want to grab a quick drink i see nothing wrong with stopping here.\\nwent during the first week so understand that they are getting the kinks out. staff was super friendly, which counts for a lot.  drinks/beer good.  food was not great.  for a menu with greek overtones, the octopus really thew me that night: strangley mushy and no char at all - could not eat it. and my pulled pork sandwich was cubed meat, only ok.  not sure that i will go back.\\nterrible food.  decent service.  i did mention every time to my server and another worker that the food was eh ok and it was merely ignored.  no probing as to why.  wouldn\\'t come back\\nthe food here is horrible.  one of the worst restaurants i\\'ve been to in philly.  i\\'ve walked by few times and atmosphere  seemed fun and the food looked good at a glance.  we had the dog with us and sat outside (outdoor seating is was nice).  my boyfriend and i decided  on sharing the mezze board and lamb burger.  everything on the mezze board was drenched in oil and the veggies salads super bland.  oil literally dripped off the board and puddled on the sidewalk below.  the lamb burger was just ok and not worth the price.  i hear they have good drink specials, but if you want a good meal...don\\'t come here.\\naverage food, descent happy hour drink specials.\\n\\nthe food was average, and for happy hour the food choices were pretty limited.  however they do have an impressive array of beers on tap all half off during happy hour which runs between 4:40-6:30, a little inconvenient for most people who don\\'t get off until 5.  \\n\\nin any case, we got the chips and cheese dip, and the sweet potato fries from the happy hour menu, but the brussels sprouts were not on special for happy hour so as mentioned pretty limited options for food during happy hour.  and they have a $5 burger i guess which is just that, a hamburger with a side of ketchup.\\n\\nfor the future i\\'d definitely come here for drinks but i will likely not be coming for any food.\\nif you come here, get burgers and beer. had a pizza on a previous visit and it was like something i would have made in my toaster oven when i was in 5th grade. however, the lamb burger and sally smothers burger are fantastic! great beer selection, 1/2 off for hhr (4:30-6:30).\\ngood.  forgettable.  weird lighting. will try it once more before a full-blown assessment.  they must mute the outrageously bright florescence coming from the open kitchen -- it\\'s an ambience destroyer. very strange selection of background music -- as if the kitchen staff chose it for their amusement or to ensure the tables turn over.\\nas a  local, i appreciate the great job of transforming that corner of the neighborhood, it  looks great. warm and inviting inside too, and the waitstaff was top notch. unfortunately, that\\'s where it ended. wasn\\'t  a menu that i was interested in so since i am a burgerphile i tried the chef\\'s \"signature\"burger. ok, so it\\'s \"just a burger\", but any burger over $15 should be better than \"just a burger.\"  it was supposed to be med/rare, instead i received 2 dry pucks precariously balanced on top of each other with a slice of cheese, on a hard english muffin. who puts a burger on a muffin? all this south philly bread at our doorstep and you guys use english muffins? when you try to bite into it, the pucks slide across each other, i just wanted \"a\" burger i could sink my teeth into,  2 patties are just stupid. no garnishes, no nuthin, meat was dry and tasteless. i don\\'t usually order fries, but they came with it, soggy. i set it aside after only 2 bites which totally upset the waitress, maire d, chef and owner.(maybe they thought i didn\\'t want to pay for it, but i did). the beer selection looked interesting, but my  date seemed to have been a bit shortchanged on a jameson, little stingy with the alcohol. it\\'s a shame, but i\\'m sticking to the old neighborhood hangouts.\\nopening weekend. we expected it to be busy...\\ni called this morning and asked if i could reserve a table. they said \"8 or more. any less than that, just call ahead 30 mins and we\\'ll put you on the waiting list for a table\". fine. \\nwe planned on getting there at 7:30 so i called at 6:45 to put our name in. voicemail. tried 8 more times. all voicemail. walked the 2 blocks there and spoke to the hostess, hoping to get our name in a little early. she said \"1 1/2 hours\". staring at the phone on the hostess\\' booth, \"but i called for a table\". \"i\\'m sorry, our phone system is still new\"\\nskip ahead, skip ahead. \\n2 hours and 20 minutes later, our time spent at the bar...as well as our money, we tell one of the hostesses that we will be leaving and she says that she understands and that we would probably be waiting longer for our food anyway. she thanks us for coming and apologizes for the wait. fine. \\non our way out, a member of our party speaks with the gm about the fact that were leaving before we were seated and she responds by telling us that she\\'s tired of hearing how people feel and that she\\'s fine with us leaving...\\n\\ni will say this much...i think that bsbh has potential. i think the drinks were good and the apps (we had time to get a few at the bar) were pretty good as well. \\nhowever, the managing staff needs more than a slap on the wrist. they were rude. in my opinion, the wait staff was friendly and understanding...they were great.  \\ni was, initially, very excited to pay this place a visit. 2 blocks away from our door, looked awesome and had a great selection of food and drink. \\nhowever, we will not be returning anytime soon. the gm never offered an apology for our wait or our inconvenience. we would have even been fine with a more realistic wait time. that way, we could have planned our night accordingly. but we weren\\'t given that. instead, they didn\\'t want to hear our \"feelings\". \\n\\nthis place would be awesome with a manager who understood real customer service. we all understand the growing pains a restaurant needs to go through, but good customer service is not something that comes with time. it comes with the quality of people you employ. \\n\\nwould love to love this place. hope that they get their priorities in order and their management trained a little better on how to speak with their patrons. until then.\\ni want to love this place, $5 margs and sangria (all the time) and a tremendous draft list, plus sizeable outdoor seating! but, without fail every single time i have received horrible service. i\\'ve worked in the industry, i\\'ve never asked to speak to a manager, i understand the struggle but after a second, third, fourth, and even fifth shot for them to get it right, they have still failed to provide timely or sufficient service. last time i went i waited almost 20 minutes and not a single server approached us (not even to apologize for the wait and say they would get to us soon), and there was plenty of support staff idly staring blankly around as we waited. the restaurant was only half full and the four tables closest to me had not even been given waters. it doesn\\'t matter how cheap or plentiful their drinks are if i can\\'t get someone to serve me one.\\ntimes must be tough here... i asked to sub shallots for bacon, well we can do that but there is an up charge... really?!?! bacon is more expensive then shallots... my friend orders a chicken sandwich, can i have more aioli? they respond, you have some on your sandwich.  yes but i\\'d like more, well there is an up charge.  on the positive side the burger was done to temperature, but considering there is an up charge for everything save your money; i\\'d rather go to royal.\\ni loved their brunch menu and food was good. but the service wasn\\'t so good. the servers took forever to take orders, bring orders and check, which was a little obnoxious.\\nthe previous reviews are right.   completely awful from beginning to end.   we went for brunch and ordered drinks.    they took a very long time.   my iced tea was nearly clear and had no taste.  the food took 45 minutes.  for brunch.   the pork and waffles was completely cold, rubbery, and tasteless.   it was served with watered down syrup.  the pork looked and tasted like it was boiled.   i actually laughed when it was served,   almost all of the dishes were cold and bland actually.   the only passable option was the lamb sausage.   most of our dishes were left half eaten.   gross.\\ngreat selection of beer at good prices and nice looking restaurant with decent ambiance. that said, after three dining experiences, i\\'ll simply direct the reader to the first sentence of this review..\\nfood and service are both spotty. that\\'s really about it. in a city of great bars and restaurants, spotty isn\\'t going to last. last time i went in, my gf and i sat at the end of the bar. both bartenders and two waitresses were at the other end of the bar for ten solid minutes bullshitting....we didn\\'t even get menus. needless to say, we split without even getting a drink and went to southwark. see ya!\\nwhen making our way to brunch this weekend, i mentioned to a friend that barrel house is not a place that i would normally recommend (our destination was picked by a third party), but i couldn\\'t really pinpoint why... until after we had finished our meal.\\n\\nwhile the food was solid, the wait was borderline unacceptable. the restaurant was only about half full at 11:30am and it still took ~20 minutes to find our server - find being the key word. food took 30 minutes on top of that, to the point where we had to ask for toast to hold us over while we waited. i\\'m not sure if the worst part was the total lack of acknowledgement of how long things were taking or the dishwasher that was running behind the bar next to us, which was vibrating everyone\\'s seat. \\n\\noverall, decent food but the experience as a whole was lacking and i will not be rushing back any time soon.\\nwhen making our way to brunch this weekend, i mentioned to a friend that barrel house is not a place that i would normally recommend (our destination was

good prices, able to get a seat at the bar on a saturday night = i\\'m a fan.\\n\\npersonable bartenders who weren\\'t overbearing was also a plus.\\n\\nsitting at the bar all night with over a $100 tab and no buybacks a minus, but overall had a good experience and would absolutely go back\\n\\ndidn\\'t get any food - which seems to be people\\'s problem with the place... maybe its just better as a bar?\\nthis is a great place to have a (good) beer, on draft or in bottle. i appreciate that they support local craft breweries. the staff i\\'ve dealt with have been accommodating. the atmosphere is updated and lively. i have not had any of the food, but i don\\'t think you\\'d be disappointed coming here for a beer.\\nso i gave this place another chance and it\\'s gotten so much better... clearly someone cares about the business and wants to see their customers happy. they have a great beer selection and the bar tenders are very nice and easy to talk to. well done.\\nit\\'s embarrassing how bad the service is at this place i\\'ll never be back. slow rude not knowledgeable about the menu.  checked every box\\nfive stars for beer selection\\n\\n\\nit\\'s insane.  bottles and drafts\\n\\nvery friendly staff, great location just one street south of south street.  what a lovely neighborhood.\\nfirst time at barrel house and i went with a friend for happy hour. we were able to squeeze in 2 beers in 30 minutes (luckily lol), all four of which were great. i got the queso fundido for an app, not the best i\\'ve had but i would go back for it. i also had the barrel house burger for my meal. first of all, it was more like fries with a side of a burger, but i love fries so no complaint. the burger was a little salty, not worth sending back. but the sauce was very tasty. again, not the best burger i\\'ve had but it was good overall.\\nvery nice selection of beers and wine.  however, be prepared to pay liquor tax on top of the prices.  that is a no go for me.  add it into the price so people aren\\'t taken back when they see the bill.  cheap way to make extra money off you patrons.   didn\\'t find the bar staff to be very knowledgeable of the beers or which glass was appropriate for the beer.  atmosphere was alright but not taken back.  although, outside seating looked nice.  can\\'t say anything about the food, but i won\\'t be back to try it.\\nit\\'s the only place open late other than royal in the neighborhood on a sunday night. they were playing radiohead and portishead. and ... that\\'s all the good things i can think of. strike one: the server came up to the table and announced that she was tired from working a double and could we please just point to the menu items we wanted. strike two: they list these infused liquors for $7 or $8 on the drink menu. but in fact that\\'s not the price of a cocktail made with these liquors, which are $3 or $4 more. so why have the prices of the liquors? strike three: a drink made with said infused liquor was so sweet as to induce diabetic shock. strike four: eggplant appetizer was bland and came with these chewy nuts of some sort. maybe pistachios? strike five: the cumin-laden black bean burger. you really could taste nothing else but cumin. if you love cumin, you will love it. but you probably won\\'t love the super basic side salad. strike six: server handed drinks to us through a window, and asked us to pass her the bill back through the window, rather than walk outside to our table, because she was so tired. see: strike one.\\nwhat a disappointment. my husband and i stopped by here for dessert on our anniversary after having a really nice meal on the other side of town. we sat outside to enjoy the summer evening and ambience of 6th street, and it went downhill from there. \\n\\nwhen the waiter realized we were only there for dessert he was visibly annoyed and treated us poorly. he was dismissive, abrupt, and unfriendly. he was impatient and rushed us to order. we ordered two drinks and two desserts. my husband\\'s tea came out in a filthy glass and when i pointed it out to the waiter he didn\\'t even apologize. he got him a new cup, but it was pretty gross. \\n\\nafter placing my order for peach cobbler, the waiter came out 5 minutes later and said they were out of cobbler and suggested i order something else. i ordered the cherry cake instead. our desserts came out 10 minutes apart from one another and both were edible, but not tasty. the cherry cake was dry and had little flavor, the strawberry pound cake dessert was strange. it had cubed pound cake and tons of whipped cream, but was mediocre at best. \\n\\nto put a cherry on the rude cake, the waiter spilled water all over my lap. good thing it was warm outside. \\n\\ni\\'d recommend avoiding this place and going to the dozens of other restaurants on the block. terrible experience.\\nfood is always delicious and beer list is fabulous, but we shan\\'t be returning until they fix the problem with the poor service and the slow kitchen. we always wait too long and rarely see our servers. this is such a fixable problem, so we hope that the owners do so.\\nwe live about a block away and have been there probably 6+ times since they opened. when we decide to go out for dinner on a weeknight and run through the list of usual haunts this isn\\'t one of them. its the outlier. the place you say, \"well, we haven\\'t been to barrel house in awhile, maybe we\\'ll give it a try again?\" then, out of a collective indifference, we head over there. \\n\\nwe echo all the other reviews which speak to their lack of guest service across the board. from the hosts to the bartenders to the servers. there\\'s one male server who has been there awhile who we\\'ve had a few times and was good. but you don\\'t send your kid to the school that gets crap scores but has that one teacher that everyone liked. \\n\\nwe had a meal there a few weeks back on a weeknight. when we entered, the host desk had a scented candle burning. yes, you read me correctly. we were seated at a two-top and when we declined to order anything besides the water to drink, the attentiveness dropped significantly from there. we ordered the fish and chips and a salad with grilled chicken. it wasn\\'t like we ordered fries and were taking up a two-top on a busy night. they were about 40% full. the only time we saw the waitress after the runner brought our meals was after the host overheard me intentionally responding to my fiancÃ© that the lack of attention/service \"will be reflected in her tip.\" then all of a sudden she came by to refill our waters and see if we needed anything, when we were done with our meal.\\n\\ni wouldn\\'t recommend this place to anyone. it doesn\\'t represent the diversity of great food/drink in our neighborhood.\\nthe place is a nice addition to the neighborhood, and the food is good and reasonably priced. it\\'s too bad that the service is so poor, or i would visit this place more often. me and my dining companions as well as other people in the bar and restaurant were constantly trying to flag down wait staff on a recent night when the place was not that crowded. be prepared to wait and don\\'t come expecting good (or friendly) service. if you are in the neighborhood, beau mode and good king tavern are much better alternatives.\\ni came here on a whim with some friends. it was a little slow but non the less good. the house dressing for the salad was great and so is the beer! ill be back for sure!\\nboring. boring drinks menu. boring food menu. boring atmosphere. when i moved to the neighborhood i was excited to be able to walk to such a cool looking place but now that we\\'ve been 4 times i kind of hate it. went last week with my husband and a friend they got burgers neither one was cooked right. my husband ordered his medium well and it was medium, they mentioned that the meat had a sweetness to it which seemed odd to me but later that night he was in the bathroom. i got chicken and waffles i was excited to try the whiskey syrup which didn\\'t taste like anything other than super sweet maple syrup, it didn\\'t even smell like it had been infused with whiskey. the mixed drinks are all whiskey drinks, which is fine, but they\\'re all pretty unappealing. this place seems to be confused about what direction they want to go in. i\\'m pretty sure the only reason they\\'re still around is because they offer outdoor seating. \\nthe one plus is their beer and whiskey selection which is very extensive, maybe too much. with all the specialty beers they should offer more ciders.\\ndon\\'t waste your time.\\ni went to barrel house sunday for brunch with a friend. i got the sausage hash, which in the past has been very flavorful, spicy and delicious. this one was lacking in flavor. they must have changed chefs because i noticed key differences: the sausage was no longer in a crumble type fashion (instead it was just links that seemed to be sliced up), it was not anywhere near as spicy as it used to be (could hardly taste the jalapeÃ±os) and it no longer came in a skillet. probably wouldn\\'t go back - there are tons of other brunch places in the area\\ni loved the hummus plate appetizer i ordered but the burger was too greasy and messy ( not in a good way).  the drink specials are ok but there are better options literally blocks away.\\ni really want to like this place, but their is a weirdness to the menu. the pic shows popcorn ($3) - small bowl for this much money. higher mark up than movie theater?! i jokingly asked if there were free refills. \\npickles - best $2 i\\'ve ever spent here. very delicious. \\nand that scrawny asparagus was $5. wtf?! i was expecting thicker spears. \\nmy friend likes the beer selection (i am not a beer drinker and cannot comment, but wanted to make note).\\ni like trivia on tuesdays and no other bars around here have it on tuesday, so i shall return. \\nwould love to see different sauce options for mussels, free refills on popcorn, healthier options, and asparagus with more girth.\\nedit: a tequila special on trivia night would be amaze ;)\\ni\\'m giving this a hopeful 4, though right now we may be at a 3. we went by last night and had a very enjoyable time. the servers were in their first week, but friendly and attentive. the beer list was unique and high quality, with prices that were about average. liquor prices seemed to edge a bit on the high side, but nothing outrageous and a pretty good selection.\\n\\nthe menu is standard, but seems to have some creative and tasty spins on things. my only gripes with the food were that either the portions were too small or some of the prices were too high, and my fries came out cold. still, everything we had was tasty and high quality. i\\'m anticipating the kitchen will be running more smoothly within a short period of time, as they\\'re already doing a better than average job. if they can balance out the portion size (and they only need to look to the other end of their block to find out what happens in this \\'hood when you don\\'t...), this place could be a popular neighborhood spot.\\nwe\\'ve been here a few times and have been disappointed with the service. servers were slow and innattentive and did not respond appropriately when orders out of the kitchen were wrong and, or delayed.  tried to sit at the bar and were impressed with the knowledge and attention of the bartenders.  would only come here again for a tap take over (beer only) and bar service.  table servers were slow and lacked knowledge of food.  needs improvement.\\nok i went there during their opening week which i know is a big no-no but the press about this place was so exciting that i went for dinner. the service first off was awful. the poor guy didn\\'t know a thing about the menu or the bar. my date asked for a bourbon and coke and the waiter asked us if we could show him that on the drink menu. they were out of just about every beer i asked for (the problem with having a huge beer list) but i was light hearted about it and just told him to bring me any ipa. then came the food. the appetizers were very small but tasted ok. we had ordered the barrell house burger to split. we then saw it arrive on the table next to us while they were having their appetizers (the table next to us was not as light hearted about the bad service). when the burger got sent off their table it arrived at ours a few minutes later.... pretty sure the guy had eaten a few of our fries. the complaints about the food were coming from all tables left and right and i felt terrible for the staff. bad experience but i hope they get the kinks worked out! don\\'t know if i will go back anytime soon.\\npretty nice selection of beer and reasonable prices. the food is ok - nothing mind blowing. enjoyable atmosphere and a beautiful interior.\\ni have no complaints, service was good and food was tasty and timely. the restaurant didn\\'t blow my mind to merit 5 stars but i will definitely be back to try more if their menu.\\nfriends were in town for pax and we met up for dinner here since they said they went for burgers the night before. a couple of the specials sounded good so my wife and i decided to split them. my sandwich was meatballs with a pesto cheese sauce, balsamic onions, and hash browns. my wife had a pot roast style short ribs, and we split chili cheese tots.\\n\\ni think the tots were our favorite, though she enjoyed the short ribs. i felt like the short ribs gravy had an odd sourness to it. the meatballs sandwich was a bit much since the hash browns were very plain, and the rest was very salty without being able to pick out any particular flavors. i probably should have gone with a burger since the two entrees didn\\'t do it for me.\\ni was really disappointed. went in for a beer and there were 2 bar tenders. it took 10 minutes to get a beer in a relatively i crowded bar. the staff was too worried about end of night cleaning than the patrons. trying to close my tab was just as bad. the bartender was right in front of me and ignored me so she could finish stacking cups. \\n\\nleft a bad taste in my mouth. customer service is beyond sub par. i won\\'t be returning here.\\ni basically have been coming here since we moved to philly 3 years ago. my husband and i love this place so much because they have really good options for beer and they rotate, this means a lot for beer lovers! it\\'s a pet friendly restaurant too. my dogs always want to stop and chill here after a long walk which i don\\'t mind. even though they took away my fav dish, the brussel sprouts but still can get other good food. i  their calamari! the best time to come here for me is during a nice weather cuz i can chill with my dogs here at the outdoor seating and enjoy they excellent beer option. the service is always good, they would give our pups a treat each when we come here.\\nlove this place! they have an amazing rotating draft list at good prices, especially during happy hour. it\\'s a great place to go if you like heavier, darker beers that some bars neglect, but they have a broad variety as well.\\n\\nwhile beer is the main attraction here, the food is good too. they have a house-made black bean burger that\\'s way better than your average bar veggie burger. their other entrees, burgers, and salads are also good.\\n\\nthis is easily my favorite bar in the area.\\ndrinks and food has always been great here.   only reason why not 5/5 is because service can be spotty.  its either the best service ever or you\\'re sitting at a table to be cleaned for 20 minutes....\\nanyway they have an extensive drink menu which includes whiskey flights.  i am a huge fan to come here for drinks.  the ambiance is very cool with the dark wood and industrial lights.  \\nmy absolute favorite thing to get here is the ice cream- the guy makes it from scratch!\\nhey for a whiskey flight and some home made ice cream, i keep coming back regardless of the service.\\ni\\'ve been to bainbridge on a number of occasions for brunch, dinner and just drinks. they always have great beers on tap and in cans with an alternating nitro and barrel aged option and their bartenders are very knowledgeable. foods good, especially brunch. the host is awesome!\\n\\nwouldn\\'t recommend coming here to watch a sporting event as the tvs tend to black out every couple of seconds which can be very annoying. all in all, i will keep coming back!\\nstopped in while doing some shopping on south street. the beer list is extensive and has all my favorites. scott, the bartender is knowledgable and was able to recommend a beer and food choice for me that paired well together. when the pork sandwich arrived, i was super happy to see that the cabbage slaw mentioned on the menu was in its proper place - on the sandwich. the pork itself was the perfect combination of smokey and spicy. that, combined with the creamy slaw made me one happy girl. i finished my meal with the olive oil pound cake and salted caramel ice cream - a perfect not- too sweet, but very delicious finale to my late lunch... looks like i\\'m walking back to center city to burn off all the calories,  but it was so worth it!\\ni wasn\\'t sure what to expect from this place since the reviews here are pretty mixed! my friend and i went there on thursday night. we were happy to get a table outside and enjoyed several different beers from their extensive list. we ordered the nachos and the mezze plate. the nachos were nothing super special but we liked them! the mezze plate was gigantic, beautifully presented, and so delicious. we loved the grilled veggies and variety of dips with pita and crackers. the only part we didn\\'t love was their take on dolmas...the grape leaves were really tough. we had a great experience here and will be back for sure!\\nprobably still finding its legs\\n\\ni live in the neighborhood and am always looking for decent places for food and drink and just to hang out. i was sorry to see tapestry close. four stars for atmosphere in this place. the bar is nice and cozy. the look works. amazingly, even though it was crowded, it was easy for me to hear my companion (we were seated at the bar) without strain. the bar tender was knowledgeable and mellow. the craft beer selection was excellent. the space is divided into the bar area and the restaurant area. this division actually works. one thing that i liked about the place was the wide age range of patrons, at least the night i was there. i would give it 5 stars for this aspect of bsbh..\\n\\nthe food- disappointing. this i would give 3 stars. really too bad. i realize that one visit is not necessarily a fair assessment of a place, but they need to make the visit count if people are to return. the menu sounds interesting, but the preparation was somewhat uninspiring. crispy calamari was very good, as were the fries. the burger was over cooked- despite \"medium\" being requested. i had the parsnip gnocchi with lamb neck ragu. the gnocchi was over cooked, lacked the texture i was expecting and mostly became mush in the mouth. the ragu was bland- truly unfortunate. i bit more care with the food and maybe even taking a few risks with the preparation could make this an excellent place. \\n\\nsince i live close by, if the food improves, i will addend this review.\\nsince opening, i have already been here multiple times. the barrel house has quickly filled the void of my neighborhood spot since tapestry closed. i\\'m so glad because my liver was starting to get all cocky. \\n\\nthe staff here is great. they really believe in customer service and it doesn\\'t feel faked at all, just great people. the space itself is really modern and fairly big. i love the view into the kitchen. the only downside to the space at all are the large posts right behind the bar (you\\'ll know what i\\'m talking about when you go, and you should)\\navoid the bar seats closest to those because it\\'s tough for the servers to get by.\\n\\nthe food. my favorite things to order so far are the fried pickles and the pork belly. i can\\'t see pork belly anywhere without ordering it. its really well prepared. i haven\\'t had grilled octopus many places, but it tasted great. i was just a little disappointed with the portion size (even though its a \"small plate)\\n\\ni am not a fan of vegetarian food, but i have to say my favorite thing opening night was the slider version of the falafel burger. that was absolutely great.\\n\\nthe drinks. the beer selection is great, which i expect from a place under the bella vista distributer umbrella. they don\\'t just have a variety of styles, they have a refreshing amount of beers that i have never tried before. that\\'s really hard to imagine. a+ for that.\\n\\nand on a final note to all the haters on yelp. dont review any place on its opening night or the first time they are putting a brunch together. i wonder how most other people feel about being criticized your first day on any job. seriously.\\ni do really like a few things about this place:\\n\\na fine place to grab a drink on a weeknight. \\n\\nfrench fries are like crack\\n\\ni can walk there\\n\\nfriendly staff:)\\n\\nbut on the other hand the rest of the food i\\'ve had has been mediocre. and i had one experience that got under my skin...\\n\\nit was my friends 30th birthday (morning after). she was about to head home but we decided to go out for one mimosa. walked by bsbh and saw the chalkboard outside for $5 mimosas so we went in and each ordered one. when the bill can it was for like $20 and i mentioned the chalkboard, the bartender looked confused and looked outside, turns out it was the chalkboard for the place next door bistro la minete that had the $ 5 mimosa\\'s .the sign was right in between the two buildings, it was an easy mistake. i playfully suggest that they give the drinks to u for that price.. like come on you need to be competitive if the place next door has the same thing for half the price?!?! and it was my friend\\'s 30th birthday, we were practically the only two people there and we each got one mimosa,come on. \\nneedless to say they didn\\'t give us the $5 mimosa\\'s. :( thats the only reason we went in there in the first place. shame on us i guess!\\ngreat service and great food! awesome neighborhood spot! meghan a wonderful server! i recommend this for a casual dinner spot!\\nservice was incredibly slow, disorganized and not knowledgeable. took forty five minutes for our order - the fried tomato salad (tomatoes weren\\'t properly tried, the arugula was doused in dressing so heavy it looked like soup) and the french toast burger, which was bland, lacking seasoning and punch. never got water, server was all over the place. unfortunately we won\\'t be coming back :(\\ni really hate giving any business a 1 star review, but my family and i had to most awful experience here on sunday. we had reservations for my birthday brunch here and were seated right away. our waiter took a while to come over and take our drink order. it then took at least 15 minutes for us to get drinks, which was insane. however, this was not the worst part. we sat there for an hour and 15 minutes waiting for food! we ordered various egg dishes, so there is no reason for it to take that long. everyone around us was also waiting so there must have been a kitchen issue, but this was never communicated to us. we had to leave by 2:15 and told the server and he was very checked out and said the food was coming. after another 10 minutes, we had to leave. we were starving and so mad. no one ever came over to apologize or explain why this happened. they definitely should have comped our drinks and they did not even do that! there are so many other great restaurants in philly so do not waste your time with this poorly run establishment. i will not be returning and will dissuade everyone i know from going as well.\\nfood- loved my $5 bloody.. you cant beat that weekend price. i really enjoyed my vegan hash. it had tons of food and a great variety of ingredients including tofu- i did add some hot sauce and ketchup because i felt like it needed some kind of sauce. my friends enjoyed their meals as well. the cream cheese tasted smooth and flavourful.. not sure if it was store bought or something unique but it worked.\\nservice- seated and service was prompt and pleasant. no complaints\\natmosphere- sat outside(covid) and enjoyed the shady spot and good vibes.\\nthe food was mediocre and the service was so slow. i went on a wednesday night and there were very few people there but it was 45+ minutes before we got our food. it\\'s a nice spot but i\\'m disappointed.\\ncame here a few weeks ago for dinner on a saturday and i loved it! we had no issue getting a table, which is always nice.\\n\\nthe mac and cheese was soooo good. i would go back just for that. they also have a really impressive beer selection. i had the camilla chicken sandwich which was pretty good, but not my favorite.\\n\\nthe service was also great. really attentive but not overbearing. overall i had a great experience there and would definitely recommend anyone to check it out!\\nthe beer and whisky selection is very good. service was attentive and kind. wings were a little burnt, but tasty. the mac and cheese appetizer was delicious and a perfect portion as an app. the camilla chicken sandwich was tasty too. i would go back.\\nwent here to kick off philly beer week and they had no specials that reflected this event. we stayed for quizzo but the quizzo guy (phil) was so unenthusiastic that i may as well have been watching masterpiece theater. they were out of 3 of the 5 things we ordered too. the best part about our visit, our servers much appreciated honesty about what not to order and an answer during a round of quizzo.\\nwent to bainbridge street barrel house for the first time last night for game of thrones quizzo. the space was incredibly small and incredibly crowded (which i\\'d expected) but the overall ambiance was super cozy and cute. \\n\\ni was seated almost immediately and was impressed by the variety and quantity of beer & whiskey offerings! unfortunately, it quickly became clear that that the bar had not anticipated the number of people who showed up, as they were wildly understaffed and, as a result, service was ridiculously slow. it took 40 minutes for a waiter to even come over to my table and greet us/bring waters/take our orders. it was another 40 minutes before the beer i\\'d ordered arrived - meaning it took nearly an hour and half from the time i walked through the door for me to receive my drink. my frustration in this was compounded by the fact that all of the tables around me had ordered and received 2-3 rounds of drinks (including cocktails) before my single beer arrived.\\n\\nthe service improved as the night went on, and the quizzo itself was fun. i also ordered some food, which was pretty good as well. the staff was all very polite, albeit frazzled.\\n\\nif you\\'re going to go on a crowded night (like themed quizzos) i absolutely recommend getting there early, if for no other reason than to get your drink orders in. i plan on going again, and am hoping this was a one-time error and the bar isn\\'t always understaffed.\\nan added two stars for the personal apology from management.  the message also indicated that the bartender has been let go.\\nthe beer selection is great, despite the schizophrenic pricing. i haven\\'t eaten the food, but it looks tasty.  the bad review is for the female bartender who served us this past sunday afternoon.\\n\\nnot only did she fill an overly priced beer into the wrong and much smaller snifter glass (thus increasing the already outrageously priced mediocre beer) but she spent the good part of the afternoon talking to two individuals at the far end of the bar.  on one occasion she walked past my empty glass (which was pushed as close to her as possible to emphasize its emptiness) to get her cell phone to show the two at the bar something on her phone.  also, when you charge someone $11 for 10oz of beer, you should ask them if they are enjoying it.\\n\\nwith all the great craft bars in the area why pay for terrible service?\\nfirst experience here was awful. my wife and i sat at the bar which was mostly empty and were blatantly  ignored by the bartender for 10 minutes, then left. this was over a year ago. on a whim, we went back for brunch a few months ago, had great service, the food was decent and the atmosphere is very relaxed. we have been back several times now, with similar pleasant experiences. nothing that will knock your socks off as far as the food goes,but it is very good. their beer list is very well selected and have some fantastic bourbons as well ....\\n(they have pappy on their menu!) a nice neighborhood type watering hole with solid food is always a welcome addition in my book. \\n(also... family friendly. we bring our little one with us with no problems)\\ntheir food is ok, specifically the brussel sprouts, but their drinks are consistently bad and overpriced. went there yesterday and ordered a tito\\'s dirty martini. the first one was only about half way full (in an already very small glass), and was the color of olive juice and tasted gross. i asked them to fix it (which was uncomfortable enough because i never send food/drinks back), so they took it back and it was *slightly* better upon return...as in it tasted like there might actually be a little booze in it. second one was so gross, it tasted like it was made with water instead of any vodka. i couldn\\'t even finish it it was so bad. $11 each. total fail. \\n\\nthis is just my most recent experience. i\\'ve gone here at least 10 times with the highest hopes for a good place to get drinks since the place itself is pretty cool. every single time i\\'ve been seriously disappointed with the drinks and much more so when i got the bill. i\\'m ok paying the price for a good drink, but i think here it\\'s time to face the facts that making good drinks clearly isn\\'t their focus. \\n\\ni gave it two stars instead of one because the decor is nice, but stick with the brussel sprouts, they\\'re always good.\\nawesome spot in queens village to get some brunch. eclectic menu and great outdoor seating, never had to wait for a table.\\nfood was ok, beer selection was great, but service was seriously lacking. our server was taking care of my entire family and had 0 sense of urgency, mind you it was not busy. i asked if i could box up my food and it was brought back to me with the container all wrapped in a plastic bag and tied tight. got home, took out my food and there was nothing in my box but homefries. i had asked him to box up a half plate of food. my entire main meal was gone. and half of my girlfriends omelette, gone. should probably teach your workers that when you wrap things you don\\'t throw away the whole meal first. very disappointed, i\\'ll be sure to not recommend this place ever again. i felt terrible for bringing my family there. best of luck to you, barrel house.\\nspace has great potential, but the food and service were terrible. our experience started with bad coffee, continued with terrible service, and ended with bad food. they advertised brunch, but only had a lunch menu. the server spilled water all over my lap, brought me towels so i could clean it up, but left a pool of water at my feet. spills happen, i get it. but at least comp a drink or the terrible coffee, if not an appetizer or sandwich. we were one of two tables in there and the food took forever. everything was greasy, even the grilled chicken. leaving with a stomachache and a cold, wet lap.\\ni went here one afternoon after work with a friend. we sat outside because the atmosphere is nice and it was a beautiful day. our waitress brought us waters and we told her we needed a few more minutes before ordering. she walked by more than a handful of times without ever stopping. we saw her bring drinks and food to the table next to us. after 10-15 minutes of her not even looking at us, we just left. \\n\\nmaybe the food is good but i guess i\\'ll never know.\\nabsolutely love the food! i got a cheeseburger with feta cheese and an egg and it was amazing!! will for sure be returning!\\npoor service.  long but uninspired draft list.  no one in my party enjoyed their entrees or their beers, despite ordering within our tastes.\\nmy girlfriend and i went for brunch the first day they opened the patio for summer. it was packed, and they only had two servers for the whole place. food was mediocre, it did the trick. there are definitely better options in the neighborhood.\\nwas super excited to check out their coffee beer brunch this weekend with my boyfriend. the tap list was great although maybe just a smidge pricey ($16 flights?). it\\'s a special event so whatever. the place was packed and loud. our waiter came over to take our drink order and it was a good thing we didn\\'t have any questions because we literally had to point to which beer we wanted so that he could copy out every letter of the brewery and name of each beer. we put in our food order shortly after, got our drinks and proceeded to....wait. and wait. and wait. it took at least 35 minutes for our food to come out. and i didn\\'t see anything else coming out of the kitchen either. i wouldn\\'t even have minded so much if maybe someone had spoken to us at all or even acknowledged we\\'d been waiting when we finally did get our food. again, they were obviously pretty busy, but a \"so sorry the kitchen is backed up your food will be out shortly\" would have gone a long way. once we finally did get our dishes, i was underwhelmed. i had the southern benedict and somehow the pork and sausage gravy were just entirely bland. the dish had a lot of potential, but just did not measure up. to their credit, the eggs were perfectly poached. my boyfriend had the french toast burger cooked medium and there was no pink to be found in that burger. it was a fun brunch concept though. i wouldn\\'t be in a hurry to head back, but i wouldn\\'t rule it out if something on the tap list intrigued me.\\nthink of bar food prepared by a chef instead of a cook. these guys know how to take seemingly polar opposite ingredients and combine them in a way that incorporates their natural delicious flavors without masking them behind copious amounts of salt and butter. try the french toast burger medium. oh and the draft selection is top notch.\\nsurprised by the mixed reviews, we love this place. bar food but a lot tastier than average. they\\'re always super friendly, food with kids and tables are comfortable. wish they had a few healthier options and more lagers over ipas, but it is a great place. worth checking out.\\ni really wanted to keep liking the barrel house but having been there on five different occasions it is only getting progressively worse. the first time it was excellent.  the food was good and service great. any time after that it was hit or miss each time they were out of several things on the menu and the beer selections were limited. this last time and it will be the last time the chef quit that morning, they were out of many food items and what we ordered was super greasy. despite the fact that the place was nearly empty for a weekend our food took forever and the music was entirely too loud. this place will not be around much longer. i feel very bad about that. our server was very sweet however. hope she finds a new job soon.\\nwe absolutely love this restaurant and is the perfect neighborhood feel good place to go with family, friends or to sit at the bar. great staff and an attentive owner make this a fun night out. their burgers , fries and fish and chips are just as good as eating them in england. creative desserts and the best selections of on taps beers/ ciders are also  the best.\\nthe service here kills this place.  my roommate and i stopped in for a couple of cocktails last night.  they put us outside, got our drinks and promptly forgot about us for about an hour.  no refills, no food offered.  we actually had to walk into the restaurant to ask for the check, and then bring the check back in with my debit card.  so bad!  it\\'s a shame because the drink was very, very good and the space is pretty.\\nwent here on a saturday afternoon for lunch. we sat outside but the it was a nice day so all of the windows were open so even if you didn\\'t sit outside you could still enjoy the beautiful weather. \\n\\non weekends they don\\'t serve lunch until their brunch menu ends at 3 so we ordered lunch. i got an omelette and my boyfriend got the lamb eggs benedict which were both great. service was pretty quick and relatively friendly. all in all a vey nice experience.\\ni will say one positive thing about bsbh; the beer selection was pretty impressive. beyond that, i see no real reason to come back here and several reasons to flat out avoid the place altogether. the service was poor from the minute we walked in; we stood up front waiting for several minutes for someone to show us to a table. once seated, it was quite a while before anyone deigned to take our drink orders. everything just got slower from there, with our second beers not arriving until the end of our meal and our having to ask twice for the check. the restaurant was not remotely crowded and our server did not appear overly burdened with tables, so i\\'m not entirely sure why everything took so long. \\nthe food was plain old bad, particularly for the price. my fried chicken was in fact two smallish chicken tenders with sickly-sweet sauce on top. the mashed potatoes and broccoli were both soggy and cold by the time the plate showed up. all for a princely sum of $18. \\nthe strength of the beer menu might be enough for me to sit at the bar for happy hour at some point, but i will most definitely not come back here for dinner.\\none of the go-to places for when we want to eat out, be stuffed, but not drop an obscene amount of money in the area. the portions are big, the food is tasty, you can easily cut-out the carbs if you need to, and there are substantial beer and whiskey options. no brainer!\\ncame here for dinner with 3 hard to please people.\\nnot big beer lovers/drinkers, but the ipa i ordered was nice, and well priced.\\nthe big bonus was the food.  the people i was with (remember, hard to please) were skeptical when they were looking at the menu.  we all took a little leap of faith and ordered.  all of us (all!) were really happy.  the appetizers, fried pickles and chef eric\\'s wings, were fantastic.  one of our group said he the idea of fried pickles was repulsive.  once they arrived (very quickly) and he saw how we were devouring them, he joined in.  he loved them, and totally ate the most.  the wings were spicy and tangy, really enjoyable, and a different flavor than anything i\\'ve tasted.  \\nthe fish and chips entree was fantastic.  it was well cooked and seasoned perfectly.  two of us had burgers.  good quality meat and cooked to order.  one us us just got the mac and cheese appetizer as an entree.  smooth and creamy and surprisingly topped with crushed up goldfish - really worked well.\\nthe service was perfect!  i mentioned our group was hard to please - we all agreed that 25% wouldn\\'t be a big enough tip.\\ni was really happy to see this place in the neighborhood.  it was a big improvement over the run down shell that stood in its place for so many years.  loved it and will be back!\\nps:  i really loved the mason jar light fixtures.\\nwent on a friday night with friends for drinks, and as it turns out, ice cream. but otherwise, i didn\\'t try any of the food. the restaurant warm and cozy on a cold night. upper-scale neighborhood bar vibe. it wasn\\'t too packed so we were able to easily snag a table in the bar area. it feels a little difficult to give a comprehensive review but overall was very happy with my first experience there!\\n\\nservice: 5 stars- alice was amazing! she gave great recs, was friendly, and answered our extensive ice cream-related questions! she\\'s a gem\\n\\nhomemade pumpkin ice cream: 5 stars- the very best! all the flavors without being too sweet. creamy and delicious! we also tried the lavender creme brÃ»lÃ©e which was interesting...i\\'m excited to try all their other homemade (in-restaurant) ice creams like habanero citrus and blackberry basil.\\n\\nbeer selection- 4 stars- fairly extensive tap selection but not a single ipa on draft. weird. \\n\\nif i lived in the neighborhood,  i\\'m sure i\\'d be back this week, but its a little trip down from my hood. regardless, definitely planning to go back for more beer and ice cream and hopefully try some of the yummy looking food!\\nif i\\'d only been here once, this would probably be a three star review. having said that, i continue to find myself here because it\\'s near my friend\\'s house in philly, they are open early for lunch (which was nice when i was really looking for brunch on a monday at 11), and they\\'re a solid go-to option for food and drinks.\\n\\nthe beer menu is impressive, though that\\'s not really my jam. i can vouch for the strength of the mixed drinks though! \\n\\nservice is solid, nothing crazy good but not bad in any way. on the most recent visit we did witness a strange job interview, but it was more amusing to oversee than anything else, and didn\\'t detract from the experience. (also, it was like 11am on a monday, so totally understandable.)\\n\\nthe food is solid, too, with a nice variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, etc., and definitely something for everyone. \\n\\nit\\'s a nice neighborhood spot, nothing super special, but a good place to know about in the area. prices are super reasonable, too, which is nice when you compare to other places in the neighborhood.\\nthis place is great and a welcome addition to my neighborhood!  the beer selection is huge and reasonably priced...a nice change from the usual $8 beer night you have at most places with so many microbrews.  the food reminds me a bit of the wishing well\\'s menu back when it was decent, and all of the fries look amazing!  service is fabulous!  i can\\'t say enough good things about this place!!\\nwe had a group of 6 get together at bainbridge on 8/26/16. to say the least is was a bizarre experience. i dont know where to start. it was the most awkward service any of us had ever experienced...cringe worthy. we were ready to drink and eat all night...but i feel like it was this \"servers\" first time in a restaurant. lets give \"o\" some help. 1.give your name to the table 2. make eye contact...dont awkwardly stare at the ground while waiting on a table. 3. take a drink order...then food...not weird chunks of food drink order. 4. after food is dropped...come back...ask how it was!:) atleast once! 5. everyones drinks are empty...water and booze...sell drinks! get that bill up! 5. if someone comes to the table...dont awkwardly walk by 3 times without asking if they want a drink or food! get that bill up! 6. after finally giving that new person a menu....come back!!!!! 7. a table shouldnt have to flag you down....its not fun for anyone. 8. (still see number 4.&5.) 9. if serving coffee...make sure its not cold. 10. drinks still empty...server comes back...takes one drink order....5 other empty glasses. i dont know...we were not demanding at all...pretty much had one drink each.\\n dont think we will be back due to service. nice beer menu. average food...some things burned but server was too bizarro to ask...ever. none of us had a positive experience....but we live to tell the tale of our extremely awakward bizarre poor service....sell that menu \"o\"!!! benefits you with a tip!! makes your restaurant money!!! gets us drunk and happy and gets you a tip!!! weird.\\nwent in for after dinner drinks and was extremely impressed with the vast selection of whiskey both rare allocated selections and regularly attainable varieties that they had available. the pricing was pretty fair as well and the staff was eager to answer any and all questions i had about certain selections and took the time to help make my selections without rushing me.  definitely a place to check out if you are a serious whiskey lover.  this will now be one of my regular stops to visit when i\\'m out and about in the city .\\ngreat restaurant and exactly what is needed in the neighborhood.  first week, yes, which explains some of the hiccups that some on yelp have experienced.  we have been here twice: once last saturday and this evening.  both times the food was great, and not only the beer, but also the wine, were above par, and the staff very friendly and accommodating.  \\n\\ndue to the newness of the place, some of the beers were not available, though not a reason to bash the place to the degree i have seen on yelp.  i, too, am from the a neighborhood.  i have full confidence that this place will do great.  it fits the bill as far as i am concerned in regard to the ambiance, the menu, beer options and the staff.\\ni went to taste the oak aged manhattans and they were delicious.  kevin, the manager is a great host and introduced us to our fantastic bartender and talked us through the menu.  i filled my growler, ate a delicious meal and took a yummy dessert home.  i will be back\\nfood was great. we had the fish and chips and the falafel burger. menu also had lots of bar favorites with a twist. ambience and service was terrific!  bar menu was extensive.  family friendly as well. all in all, it\\'s a nice local place that we\\'re happy to frequent.\\nwith such convenient location, lovely interior, and great service, the food is shamefully average. the prices are very compatible but come on, you open a resto in the heart of queen village/bella vista, right next to bistrot la minette and beau monde....you got to offer something more than reasonable prices. more two and a half star feeling but 1) the service is very nice; 2) this is a new place so hopefully they are still working out the kinks. hubby votes for giving it another try, i\\'m leaning towards spending my time and money elsewhere.\\ni am happy to report that they finally put it all together and  we can add bainbridge street barrel house to our brunch list. it\\'s not that there\\'s a shortage of brunch restos in south philly but miraculously all of them have an average wait time of one hour so an additional choice is always a big plus. service is great, as always, food is tasty, prices are very reasonable (can\\'t beat this one in extremely overpriced philly), the space is new and clean, and the outside seating is nice and ample. loved my french toast this morning  (and priced at $7, it\\'s even more appealing!), and looking forward to being back some time soon.\\ni am happy to report that they finally put it all together and  we can add bainbridge street barrel house to our brunch list. it\\'s not that there\\'s

selection\\nvery mediocre, my friend and i stopped her for a quick bite and a few drinks. we got:\\n\\n- spiked sangria: this was ok\\n- chicken nachos: bland, so bland. chicken had no seasoning, was cooked until dry, chips didn\\'t seem like it had salt, guac also had no seasoning. it\\'s bad when you have to dump salt onto your plate of nachos..\\n- crab fried rice: this was good. right amount of spice. although i only found one shred of crab meat. skimpy. \\n\\nall in all, service was fine, a bit awkward but fine. food was not impressive, i would\\'ve been happy with a wawa hoagie.\\nfriendly staff at the bar. some pretty decent cocktails. \\n\\ndidn\\'t have anything off the menu so cannot comment on food quality. i\\'d come back for drinks for sure.\\ngreat ambiance. the patio is fantastic and cozy. loved the charred octopus and grilled pizza two ways-mushroom. the beer selection is also amazing!\\nthis is difficult because i think that both the food and the beer selection are top notch.  i mean i really enjoyed everything i ate and drank.  the best advice i can give is to go here to drink or to eat at the bar.  the bartenders were awesome, they knew all about the beers and they gave us great service.\\n\\nthe problem really started when we decided to sit down to dinner.  we had actually planned to meet for dinner and had only been waiting at the bar for a table.  the reason we spent so much time at the bar was that the hostess forgot we were there waiting for a table.  not once, but twice.  \\n\\nonce we sat down the service was really bad, especially bad for a craft beer bar.  the server seemed to know absolutely nothing about beer.  as in, i\\'m not sure he knows the difference between beer and chocolate milk.  he kept bringing us the wrong things, so we had to start physically pointing to the menu in order for him to get the order right.  i would think that any server in a place basically built around beer should at least know the basics.\\n\\nadditionally our server was slow and just generally unhelpful to us.  when we requested the check his face lit up like he had won the the lottery.  i finally realized he just wanted to go home! \\n\\nso, as much as i\\'d like to give a better review to this place, i really think they should just stop trying to be a restaurant and just be a great bar that serves good food and great beer. because that is what they are!\\ngoogle states they open at noon, and the menus posted outside state they open at 11. we waited outside until 12:10, knocked and even called but got no response. i don\\'t know when they actually open, but they need to update their information. we were on a tight schedule and it was extremely inconvenient that they were not open when all available materials stated they would be.\\ni\\'m only  giving a 3 because of the atmosphere. otherwise the food is horrible and service, eh, ok. and i\\'m not just someone in the neighborhood for the day. i\\'ve come here many times and never had a good dish. burgers suck. ratio is way off. chef 101 here. \\nthe chicken pot pie would taste better with campbell\\'s soup. it\\'s ashame, so much potential here but they just need to suck it up and hire a good chef. \\nsorry. i\\'ll be back for that occasional, convenient beer. cheers\\nmeh. we live nearby and were pleased to see a seemingly decent spot open up. it appeared completely out of character for the south street area (which is awful and most locals hate) so we had high hopes.headed over for dinner/drinks on a saturday night a few weeks later.\\n\\ncertainly a decent beer selection and the bartenders were pleasant enough, but they missed the point of food service. they took our order and delivered when it came out of the kitchen, but were complete ghosts otherwise (even when standing directly in front of us chatting with other staff.) unfortunately, our food was disappointing, too. we ordered 2 apps to munch on and maybe ate 1/3 of each. the calamari remoulade was inedible it was so spicy (we really enjoy spicy food) and the mac & cheese bland and lukewarm. we reluctantly ordered entrees thinking they might surprise us - should have known better. we had the pulled pork sandwich and salmon. both were unremarkable, the pork dry.\\n\\nneighbors in sh/qv are hungry for nice options near home and ready to spend without needing to go across town. considering the aforementioned local landscape, perhaps a greater focus on staff training and menu development than a fancy facade and a massive beer selection could start to fill that void.\\ni was so excited to have this place open in our neighborhood! it\\'s a great looking space. the place has potential, but needs a few major tweaks in order to garner repeat biz in this hood.\\n\\n1) no beer specials even during the happy hour window. when we asked if anything was on special, the bartender brushed us off saying, \"no. we don\\'t discount.\" we were the only people seated at the bar, so it\\'s not like he was in the weeds.  the draft prices were higher than other beer bars in the city and the list was very light on the local stuff.\\n\\n2) portions are insanely small for the price. if you go the small plates route, over order. the food quality seemed good, but the portion size was almost laughable. \\n\\non the plus side, the burger was one of the better ones that i\\'ve had lately.\\nand the staff - socially awkward bartender aside - could not have been nicer.\\nnot busy at all for a saturday night, easily got a table. started off with the maine stout beer, which was good but really didn\\'t hold a candle to other maine craft breweries. calamari was safe, crispy, tasty, but the an unexpectedly small portion. for the entrÃ©e, i had the farmhouse burger which contained a dollop of goat cheese and a side of aioli. the sauce was very acidic and too thin. the burger, while cooked appropriately, had grill marks that were burnt and emitted a excessively charred flavor. service was fine, but i probably won\\'t come back here again.\\n\\nnote that on saturday there is a bottomless mimosa/bloody mary promotion from 10-3 at 25 bucks / person. maybe something to check out?\\nwent for the 3rd time on thursday, the \"night of the great hop,\" a night when most of their taps were serving up ipas. we had been last sunday for brunch and when our very friendly bartender realized we liked ipas, he mentioned the event. what to say? incredible for a couple of hopheads! service at the barrel house is great - i think they really want to make things right for you. example: on sunday at brunch i had an omelet and the manager asked how it was. i said great which the omelet was, but the toast (basic store variety wheat bread) could use some jazzing up. he said thanks for the suggestion and i think he meant thanks and that he would try to make it better. the same day the same manager took our order and my fiance who loves all things pork related asked about the porkenstein. the manager gave a detailed and animated description of the pork filled sandwich. my fiance ordered it and could not have been happier - an ipa in one hand and pork galore in the other. \\n\\nwe\\'ll be back not only for these reasons, but they\\'ve got a good, honest to god happy hour, with various half price beers. i think for a new place they are trying hard to make something special and i\\'m hoping it succeeds.\\n\\nbtw - the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because so far i\\'ve only had that omelet and calamari (which was delicious). i\\'d like to eat once more before i go to 5 stars.\\nstopped by here with friends for dinner on a tuesday night. disappointed they were out of the beer i was interested in. when i asked for recommendations from the waiter he seemed confused and could offer nothing. \\nthe waiter overall seemed confused and unsure. like a bus boy got stuck handling tables when a server didn\\'t show up or something. \\nwhen we finally ordered food, the one item i wanted on the menu was out. would have been nice if he had said something! it was weird that on a tuesday a main menu item is out. specifically it was the toast pork sandwich on a sarcone roll. instead i got pulled pork that was described to have apples and onions i think. it was just pulled pork and cheese on some panini bread. \\nmy friend got the greek poutine, which sounded good but the beef lasted funny. the beet salad was pretty decent and the queso was ok. \\nprobably would try eating anywhere else in the area next time.\\ndon\\'t go here for lunch on a weekday.  we should have been forewarned when there was only one table occupied.  the food was ok but the service was abysmal - took over 45 minutes to be served and too long to have our order taken.  the coffee was lukewarm, even after asking for a hotter cup.\\nfood was great and the portions were decent sized.  beer and drink selection was good.  4 stars because the service was ok-our waiter was nice enough, but didn\\'t seem to be too well versed with the menu.  hostess was a sourpuss who looked like she wanted to be anywhere other than there.\\nwe really wanted to like this place. we were a casual group looking for a new quizzo home and thought this could be the place until we received absolutely horrible service. the server was not at all knowledgable about the draft list. we received two beers that did not seem to be at all what we ordered. one beer was returned, despite his initial insistence that it was the correct beer, bc it was very obvious a stout and not the belgian that had been ordered. after questioning the 2nd beer multiple times, we drank it, because we assumed we ordered it and didn\\'t want to be difficult. once our check came, we had been charged for a beer that had never been delivered because the keg had kicked, another wrong beer, and, lo and behold, the beer we had questioned several times had not been what was ordered even after multiple inquiries. when this was pointed out, we were told we had to pay for the beer bc we drank it, even though he at this time acknowledged that it was incorrect. given the several errors, we asked to speak with the manager to resolve the issues. the manager never came, the server stated he had spoken with the manager and although the beer that was never delivered, was removed, the incorrect beers were never removed or even discounted. while we don\\'t begrudge the money, although the differences in price were substantial given that they were not cheap beers, the unwillingness of the staff and manager to admit or even address their mistakes left all of us with a bad taste in our mouthes. needless to say, we will not be returning and have advised friends not to either.\\nregular spot i come to for the whiskey and the burgers. delicious hot spot to take advantage of the next time you are nearby\\nthis is my first review on yelp. typically even if i have a bad meal (which is really rare) it\\'s not bad enough to write about. unfortunately, the barrel house was indeed that bad. \\n\\nto start at the beginning, we waiting nearly 10 minutes for our waiter to come over after being seated. once he finally came over we placed our order and let him know we were in a bit of a hurry to see a show. our beers came quickly but after that we waited almost 45 minutes before we started to worry. from there we had to go over to the maitre\\'d stand and ask about the status of our order. she went to go check the kitchen and after 5 minutes another waitress came over and asked what we ordered because they didn\\'t have our order. after another 10 minutes our empanadas finally came out. they were somewhat cold and tasted like they had been cooked quickly in a microwave. after our entree came (we were sharing the chicken sandwich) and we finally finished, we waited yet again for our check and and our waiter (who we saw for the first time since ordering) finally came over. he didn\\'t apologize and after this point we never saw him again. we eventually took our check and money the maitre\\'d stand and walked out the door over 75 minutes after we sat down at the table.\\n\\non top of all this, i took the time to fill out the comment card since they claim to want feedback. i filled in my email address and addressed my concerns. i fully expected that i\\'d get an email saying \"our bad, give us another chance\" or \"grab a beer on us\" or even a \"we\\'re really sorry\"  but now three weeks later i haven\\'t heard a thing. \\n\\nfinal thought: there are way too many great restaurants with great beer lists to ever go back to the bainbridge street barrel house.\\ntoday, i gave this place a second chance to erase the disappointing brunch my wife and i had here about 6 weeks ago and again this place with regards to food really falls flat.  despite quality service from the server behind the bar today coupled with a unique quality beer selection, the food was just miserable to the point where i tried to muster through this chicken thigh sandwich thinking it was going to transcend into a succulent sandwich; it never evolved and it was horrible.  the chicken thigh meat rivaled the chewiness i recall when i chewed on big league chew gum as a child.  the brioche roll completely fell apart when i lifted it to take a first bite of the sandwich.  i think the appetizer i had said \"fried pickle spears\"; well they should rename it to fried pickle spear nuggets it was like ordering chicken fingers then getting chicken nuggets.  i suggestion, if you chefs at the barrel house want to know how to really serve fried broccoli spears go to memphis taproom in kensington for the real deal because what you laid out at lunch today was laughable.  to repeat, the service is really quality and i really had a great conversation with the bartender today who was working the monday lunch, but the food again was such a turn off that i will never return to this place that is unfortunately in my neighborhood.\\nwent there for sunday brunch. first of all, it wasn\\'t busy at 1 pm. beer selection was great! food was great! we had the burger on french toast and an omelet. the french toast burger was amazing! the omelet was an omelet but hey...nice and fluffy. we will be back.\\ni\\'ve bit my tongue long enough about this place.  i heard the chef, eric paraskevas, was called the barrel house\\'s \"secret weapon\" in some newspaper and i laughed out loud.  i\\'ll simply state that i think bsbh\\'s beer selection is spectacular.  i also think that service is spectacular.  unfortunately, bsbh is telling the truth when it states on its website, \"we are here for one reason...beer. craft beer.\"  because the food (which i\\'ve kept giving a shot) is ... in a word... gross.\\n\\nattempt to like the food #1:\\nopening week.  met owners (who, by the way, is the nicest couple in the whole world... so warm hearted and treated me like their own son).  drank copious amounts of good beer.  was planning to have dinner but decided to order a bunch of appetizers first.  oh. my.  crackling - gross (i\\'m from the south and this is not crackling or even a decent interpretation of crackling... fried fish skin?).  the terrine was equally not edible. calamari was overly salty.  wings were forgettable.  on this night, this was enough to get dinner elsewhere.\\n\\nattempt to like the food #2:\\nhappy hour.  had more awesome beer.  really did not want to order any food but decided to check out the menu.  the terrible dishes from the previous visit were eliminated!  maybe the food improved?  ordered thet calamari again.  and the pickled veggies.  calamari was like licking a block of salt.  on the edge of not edible.  pickled veggies were weird but passable. \\n\\nattempt to like the food #3:\\n\\nmore yummy beers.  great selection.  great staff.  again, however, lackluster food.  fried pickles were okay (not a fan of spears, prefer crinkle cut chips of the south).  wings: sauce is okay, some were kinda dry, but that\\'s probable because they were teeny tiny.  but here\\'s the big revelation:  the fries are great.  oh, don\\'t try the falafel sandwich, which my friend took a couple bite of and stopped.  apparently it\\'s also gross.  \\n\\nso in conclusion, it gets better.  i will continue to go because i love beer and i like the owners and will continue to give them money. i will also continue to try to like the food because once their food becomes good... this place will be the go-to spot.\\n\\noh this is getting long, but here\\'s a funny story:\\n\\nowners were so excited to tell me about their chef...\\nowners:  \"he was on a cooking competition on tv!\"\\nme: \"oh?  that\\'s awesome, which one?\"\\nowners: \"not sure, but he finished in third place!\"\\n\\ni later found out that he was on chopped (food network).  great show.  however, there\\'s only four contestants and third place isn\\'t that impressive, ha.\\nwent here with my wife for lunch about 10 days ago because it was near where i had just had a meeting, and wow. what an amazing meal. the food was outstanding. service was outstanding. it is not a vegan restaurant per se, but there were plenty of options for me, and things could be easily modified. my wife is not vegan, and she absolutely loved her meal. barrel house has a great atmosphere, and even the background music was great.  we\\'re going back again soon.\\nwent here yesterday (sunday) for brunch with four friends. we had to wait a while to be seated, since it was packed, but i\\'d say that\\'s pretty normal for a sunday around noon at any restaurant. i realize this place is new and probably still getting their act together, so i might try again in a few months, but i won\\'t be returning, say, next weekend.\\n\\nthe service, however, was pretty disappointingly slow. i\\'ve been to sabrina\\'s when it\\'s packed, and they\\'re on top of things. for the sheer number of barrel house employees i saw milling about, it was astonishing how infrequently our waitress (or anyone else) checked on us.\\n\\nthe food was ... average. what you\\'d expect, except it costs a few dollars more. i had the french omelet (brie, ham, and shallots), which was okay. the ham was a little questionable (more grey than you\\'d expect), but otherwise i\\'d eat the omelet again. the hash browns were spicy. no one warned me. i hate spicy things. i was not pleased. the fruit i got on the side was some diced apples and pears, plus two red grapes, mixed with a little fresh mint. that was also okay.\\n\\none of our party ordered a side of toast as we began to dig into our food, and it didn\\'t arrive until everyone had finished eating.  then the rest of us got to sit around awkwardly while she ate the second part of her meal. toast cannot possibly take that long.\\n\\nanother friend asked about the dressing on her salad (she liked it and, i imagine, would like to recreate it at home), and the waitress really hammered home that it\\'s usually made with anchovies, except not their recipe, but usually it\\'s made with anchovies, and also some herbs and stuff. not an especially helpful description. (for the curious, it was green goddess dressing, which you can easily google.)\\n\\nthen we sat around for ages waiting for the check. at least the bathrooms are nice. but overall i feel pretty meh about the whole experience.\\nhands down worst cheesesteak in philly.  messy & no flavor whatsoever.  boooo!!!  i wish i had more hands, i\\'d give it 4 thumbs down!\\ni had lunch today at the barrel house; big mistake! i was the only one in the place. i ordered a cheeseburger. after 30 min i asked the bartender, what\\'s up? he replied \"it\\'s a really big piece of meat, it takes a while to cook.\" i told the bartender, the key to lying is you have to tell a lie that people actually believe. the burger showed up after 55 min; it was dry! ate it, paid my bill, left a tip and won\\'t be back.\\ni had dinner here on saturday night with my wife. neither of us left particularly satisfied. i am hoping maybe they are still working out some of the kinks of their opening.\\n\\nafter starting with the underwhelming beer list we decided to get some snacks and sandwiches. the fried pickles had a nice tempura batter, however, the bowl they came in had a pool of grease at the bottom of it. the cracklings trio was not edible,\\n\\nmy wife had the cod sandwich, which also had a nice looking tempura batter, but had no flavor. i had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw, which turned came out as a pork sandwich swimming in vinegar with some undressed cabbage on top.\\n\\nif you\\'re looking for craft beer and interesting food there are far better choices in the city.\\nmy experience at bainbridge street barrel house was not pleasant. i went here to have a couple drinks and appetizers with co-workers on a thursday. my wife showed up with my daughter about 15 minutes after i arrived. my wife and i then took turns holding my daughter, who just turned one year old. after serving both my wife and me one beer each, another gentleman came over to our group and advised us that it was illegal to have our daughter in their bar/restaurant. i\\'ve done some research on this, and everything i have read tells me that it was within our rights to have our daughter with us. if they didn\\'t want us there, they should just say so - don\\'t make up some law that does not exist. also, everyone in the place should have been on the same page, and they obviously are not on the same page if one employee is telling us how cute our baby is and another is kicking us out because of her. it was great that my family plus all my 10 co-workers left immediately after the man said we couldn\\'t have our daughter there. all of us leaving probably cut the amount of people they had in there in half and you could tell our server was angry they\\'d kicked us out. anyway - bad experience, bad/disorganized execution by the staff, not kid friendly. whether you have a family or not, i don\\'t recommend going here. its too stuffy for a hip crowd and they don\\'t like young families either. i guess if you\\'re 50+ or your kids have gone off to college, go ahead and check it out. though that demographic doesn\\'t last too long in this neighborhood.\\ni wish this place was in chicago. half price most drafts on weekdays. food was perfect for the price. location was awesome. when i travel i love going to the areas removed from the tourist sections of town. this place delivered on every level.\\ni\\'ve only been for brunch so can\\'t comment on dinner but was fairly unimpressed. i had the chicken and waffles that was a wimpy piece of chicken on a waffle that looked like it came out of an eggo package. bloody mary tasted like straight watered down tomato juice. my friend got lamb sausage that was pretty good (albeit on the smaller portion size) and the coffee was decent. granted we were there back on their opening weekend but it will be a while before we go back in the hope they improve.\\ninoffensive, tolerable mall bar.  very regs atmosphere.  this neighborhood can do better.  maroon 5 on the radio.  solid beer selection, but overpriced.  too many beers in non-pint glasses.\\nbeen there a handful of times....food is good but service (particularly at the bar) is slow and rude as can be. past two times we have been there we sat at the bar for drinks and food. we went for dinner....place was empty...pretty much only people there.....bartender took our order....got our drinks....and dissapeared. we got our app 20 min later.....never was asked if we needed another drink. after that our food was mia...after about 25 min (45min after we placed our original order).....we asked the bartender if she knew when our food was coming out bc it had been a while since we ordered.....\\nbefore i even finished asking she said \"its been 22min\".\\nlet me just say this...\\ni have been in the restaurant industry for years....bartender...\\ni get how the restaurant biz can be....\\nso let it be known that i understand and am very sympathetic to normal restaurant happenings that go on that cause problems....\\nbut...\\nthis was flat out rude....\\n20 min later (close to an hour after ordering)\\nwe got our food....\\nand dont you know my husbands burger had a hair in it!\\nneedless to say...sadly....the bad service overshadows the good food....\\nnot worth the aggravation\\nthe food here needs so much help.  i have ordered the mac and cheese twice and both times it\\'s been a disaster. the first time it was cold, which i thought might have been the cause for the diminished flavor. the second time, it was warm and i realized whether warm or cold, it has absolutely no flavor. i apologize if this sounds mean, especially since i believe the chef might be a young kid and i\\'d hate to hurt his/her feelings. when i think of the mac and cheese dish, i picture a junior high school student coming home after school, cooking up the kraft blue box mac, and then sprinkling goldfish crackers on top. other food items have also been ordered, but nothing would ever be repeated. \\n\\n\"there\\'s an old saying in tennessee -- i know it\\'s in texas, probably in tennessee -- that says, fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. fool me -- you can\\'t get fooled again.\" \\n\\nthat said, please just go here for bar food and beers. avoid the brunch dining experience.\\nbrought my friend in yesterday for brunch. we are brunch-loving divas. a good dÃ©cor/atmosphere, delish cocktails and food, and anything above mediocre service is what we\\'re looking for. first, this place has outdoor seating and nice big windows that they\\'ll open, weather permitting, so we chose this spot because the weather was really nice. since there weren\\'t any seats available outside, we opted for a table inside near the windows which was perfect.\\n\\nservice: ehhhh. it was very mediocre. every time we asked for something we felt like we were annoying our server. my friend and i have both worked in restaurants so we\\'re pretty good about how to behave as patrons but any time we asked him something it made me cringe a little. that was whatever, but what bothered me more was our food took forever. in real life, it was more like a 45 minute wait. for eggs. and the place was hopping but not overwhelmingly packed so something was off in the kitchen. maybe not enough staff? anyway, our server did occasionally check on us and kept our drinks coming (even though his attitude was blasÃ©). so all in all: mediocre.\\n\\nthe food was okay too; nothing glamorous. i had a personalized veggie omelet, my friend had the eggs benedict. the portions were nice but i just think that after that long wait, our expectations were inflated. like, if it takes 45 minutes for our food then i hope you\\'re giving it some serious tlc. on the other hand, i loved the mimosas. i don\\'t like dinky little mimosas that are served in champagne glasses (aka the traditional way) but these were deliciously served in nice big wine glasses. thank you, barrel house :) \\n\\noverall, its a nice option if you\\'re in the neighborhood and the weather is great and you have a good chunk of time to spare. prices are very reasonable too. but otherwise, if you\\'re looking for show-stopping service and impressive food, there are better options nearby.\\nbarrel house is amazing for pretty much any time of day. we went last sunday for brunch and got possibly my favorite brunch item yet: the chicken and biscuit waffle. seriously, it does not disappoint. go check out barrel house for happy hour, dinner and brunch and thank us later! follow @table.4dos on instagram for photos and more!\\nhouse made veggie burger! great beer list and friendly owners/staff. here a few times over the years. good place.\\ncame here for 4th of july brunch with some girlfriends and had a great time!  the $25 bottomless mimosa and bloody mary deal was well worth it. the pork belly pastrami benedict was delicious!  highly recommend for any brunch outing.\\nwe ordered delivery here from grubhub on a saturday night, and i was seriously impressed.  the mac and cheese is some of the best i have had.  the mac had cut up hotdogs and goldfish crackers in it (prison style) which made it even more delicious.\\n\\nwe also ordered the cubano, it comes on thick texas toast and was another hit.  i can also vouch for there nachos and french fries.\\n\\nwith all of the surcharges for delivery, this was by no means an inexpensive meal.  none the less i would gladly order from here again, highly recommend!\\ni had the potato scramble. the eggs were fluffy, and veggies were good. it came with fresh fruit. we went for the coffee beer brunch and got to try so many coffee beers. service was good. staff was extremely helpful. the place was not too loud, but not quiet. i would recommend.\\nwe have only been here for brunch but we have been several times. the brunch menu is terrific and the service is excellent. artie is a fantastic server-ask for him. the barrel house has an  extensive list of beer and whiskey/bourbon selections along with a full bar. for us it is a hidden gem for brunch, even on the weekends it is easy to get a table.\\nwent with great expectations; left feeling hungry and disappointed. they created a nice, but noisy, atmosphere at this neighborhood tavern but they fall very short on the food they serve. neighboring tables also agreed that there just wasn\\'t enough food for the price and we all joked about where we were going from here for a real meal. and the food we had (cod, wings, burger, soup) was all pretty bad. the fries tasted good but are very greasy. all in all it\\'s a shame that the owners didn\\'t consider that people really want something for the money they spend, not big empty plates of tasteless finger food. we live in the neighborhood and we are really sad that this place is so bad. we were hoping for a regular, local go-to pub for a good meal. this ain\\'t it! it might last a while if it were on south street with the parade of tourists but not where it is. people want reasonable food for their money.\\nthis place is good! the service was super friendly, the food was delicious (though a little greasy) and the overall ambiance was really enjoyable.  there is great outdoor seating and in the summer they open up with windows so that the place is very airy and fun.  i would definitely go back and i would recommend it to my friends.  \\n\\nmy only complaint would be that it took a long time to get the food we ordered but that\\'s not a huge deal.\\nwhether you are from south philly and looking for a new place to eat, or visiting with friends, don\\'t waste your time. there are so many other excellent bars/restaurants in walking distance. we have eaten here twice and the food was mediocre. the set up is gimicky, and looks nice, but the staff and menu don\\'t measure up. the wait staff is always short handed, the temperature is never regulated, and the soda will be flat no matter how many times they change it. the food wasn\\'t terrible, but for where you are, you can get amazing food by walking just a few more blocks for the same price..\\nmiddle of the road type place. not one of those places that you would plan a night out at, its just more along the lines of \"lets just go in for a beer real quick\". \\n\\nthey do have nice tv\\'s. food was ok. had the gnocchi, it was wayyyy too heavy. wouldn\\'t get that again. \\n\\ndecent place though. if i lived around the corner from this place, i would stop in more, but since i don\\'t, i probably wont.\\nthe beer and bourbon selections are fantastic. great atmosphere. the food is not going to knock your socks off but it\\'s pretty consistent. the omelet on the brunch menu is always cooked perfectly (i hate when eggs are overlooked). \\n\\noverall i\\'d say this is a great neighborhood spot.\\ndelicious food!!! porkenstein has to be one of the best sandwiches i\\'ve ever had. loved the atmosphere as well. definitely check this place out. it should be five stars!\\nmy husband and i traveled over the bridge to dinner for his birthday. we weren\\'t sure about our dinner destination but once we saw the outside of bainbridge we knew we had to go in. we like to eat at the bar so we were delighted to see seats available. immediately upon sitting down we were greeted by andrew our bartender. he was very information and pleasant he made our experience one to remember. we ordered drinks and began to look over the menu. we checked out the specials and decided to spot a few things because all of the food looked excellent. we ordered a burger which was cooked perfectly with onion rings on top. we also had chorizo tacos which were the perfect size and great for us to share then we couldn\\'t pass up the brussels sprouts which were by far the best brussels sprouts i have ever had. they are locally grown and just so good. this place is a must go!!!\\ni\\'ve been here a few times mostly because i live in the neighborhood and keep thinking it will improve, but alas it does not.  \\n\\nthe food is hit or miss and generally is just bland.  mac and cheese as well as the gnocchi are favorless.  fish and chips are great, but they were out the last time i came.  hummus is homemade and decent.  it generally a bit pricey for the small portions so you have to order more than one item.\\n\\nthey have a great bottled beer selection, but are generally out of my first and second choices which is annoying.  i find the wines to be a tad pricey.  \\n\\nservice is notably slow and staff is not knowledgeable about the food and drink menus.  i ordered the salmon with bok choy and it came with asparagus instead .  it would have been nice if the server mentioned small updates like this when i ordered.\\n\\nlast week, i had my final meal at this restaurant.  i was with 2 others and we order a bunch of apps and each an entree.  after 20 minutes, our entrees were served.  when we inquired why we were served our entrees before our apps, they response from the waitress was that she didn\\'t know why they weren\\'t served.  we didn\\'t cause a stink, but were a bit miffed.  after trying to eat the gray looking salmon, we sent it back as it was completely inedible.  we asked to speak with the manager who apologized for the bad food, but only took off one salmon entree.  when we inquired about the lack of apps, he replied that our server was going through personal issues and that was it.  i don\\'t care if my server is going through issues- who isn\\'t?  don\\'t bring your problems to work and serve my food!  i would have expected our entire dinner to be comped, but we barely got an apology from the manager.  needless to say, the service nor the management isn\\'t up to par.  combined with bad service and bland food, i won\\'t be coming back here ever.  bottom line, don\\'t waste your time or your money.\\ngood food. good drinks. slow service. got a bloody mary and a mimosa. both were on point. omelette and eggs benedict were also delicious. the service was really really friendly but unfortunately pretty slow. perfect place for a leisurely brunch (aka great if you have no where you need to be).\\nthis was our first visit and it will surely not be our last. we sat at the bar and the bar staff was warm and welcoming. all of our appitizers were outstanding and the beer selection on happy hour was another winner. we will definitely be returning. do yourself a favor and stop in.\\nokay so i watched as they renovated the building and was excited when they finally opened... the building is beautiful and the decor inside is warm and cozy, but seating is kinda cramped and on top of each other. \\ndrinks- the beer & cocktail list is above average, i was overly impressed by the beer list and will definitely go back to do some more drinking! i had an amazing dry cider which was recommended by our server\\nnow onto the food... the food was just okay... my friend and i got a bunch of small plates to share so we could taste a number of the items. we got the mushroom fries, we felt that they needed more cheese and could have been a little crispier. the soup of the day was amazing, very creamy and lots of fresh seafood. the calamari was also amazing and fresh. the brussel sprouts were bland and lacked flavor the idea for them is great but they needed a little extra. the mac & cheese needed to be cheesier. the apple pie desert was very good and fresh and just the right size to finish off our dinner. for the two of us it was about $50, which is acceptable for the amount of food we got. the service was very good also, and they knew the menu which was helpful for our questions. \\ni want to go back to try brunch and to do some more drinking.\\ni think this place has a lot of potential, great location, interesting menu and cool beers, but it\\'s poor execution. we have seen this place for years, and our family decided to stop by. we sat outside. they gave us a four person table for six people, so being on the side walk was a little awkward. we also had a toddler, so usually that is key to servers that we can\\'t be in a location longer than an hour. we arrived about 3:30. about 3:55, he came for our drink order, so they were in transition between lunch and dinner menus. the waiter said we had to wait til four to give us the dinner menu, and he didn\\'t  come back with menus until about 4:30. didn\\'t order until like 5, food then didn\\'t arrive until 5:30, and he never came back to check on us. at this point, our toddler was going mad, and my husband had to bring our check to the hostess. he was going to complain, but he saw the manager yelling at the kitchen staff to hurry up, but to his suprise, he said the staff didn\\'t seemed to care. hot mess! he didn\\'t even feel like complaining. to make matters worse, whatever they cook their fries in totally messed up our stomachs, so gross. food wise, nachos terrible, ordered a veggie cuban that was in no way like a cuban, strange ceasar salad, and broccoli rabbe for the pork sandwich was minced. will not go back.\\n*excellent beer list!\\n*solid food variety.\\n*some tvs for watching sports events.\\n-service a bit lacking but not terrible.\\n\\nthis is a new place right off south street on 6th at the corner of bainbridge. i was impressed with how large it was inside. the selection of beers was pretty outta this world. great draft selection and a ridiculous selection of bottled beers from every corner of the earth. the burger and fries i had were delicious, not anything crazy good, but great food to accompany a great beer.\\n\\n=i foresee myself going to this place in the future for sure whenever i am down around south street.\\nhave eaten here a few times for dinner and brunch. the food is decent and the beer list is good. clean restaurant and has a good atmosphere overall. servers are friendly. service is a bit slow.\\nfive stars for beer selection, four stars for food, one star for service.\\n\\nmy second time to this place.  first time also left a poor impression on service.  this time around, i came with a party of four for brunch on a sunday after the philly 10k.  restaurant had two other larger parties (maybe 6 and 10 people each?) sit just before us.  we were greeted and placed our drink orders right away.  about 10 minutes later, the server asked if we wanted to place our food orders (even though we still hadn\\'t received our drinks).  when we said we were waiting for a couple others to join before ordering and asked if we could have our drinks, his response was, \"oh, you wanted those now?\"  no, sir.  we wanted our drinks tomorrow.  he explained they were \"very busy\" and with only one bartender, it would take a bit longer.  the rest of the service was somewhat lackadaisical, but the persona of this particular server left a bad taste in everyone\\'s mouth.  unlike the food, which was actually quite tasty (chicken and biscuit waffles).  we also watched the hostess turn away several patrons who wanted to dine throughout our stay, even though the restaurant was only at half-capacity at most, because they couldn\\'t handle the foot traffic.\\n\\ni can\\'t fully blame the service on this day, as this is also a management issue for not properly staffing.  they should be more aware of events in their neighborhood.   could have been a great opportunity to capitalize on 4,500 parched and hungry runners that were three blocks from their doorstep.\\nnot a bad place for beers. but stay away from the food. the cook is a sweaty fat guy who\\'s always in the food window wiping sweat from his face with his hands then touching food and plates. also caught him rubbing his nose twice, and doing other wierd gross stuff. seriously barrelhouse clean up your act. at least get a floor manager. nobody running the show.\\ngreat atmosphere, staff, menu and beer selection.  see you again soon !!!\\n\\nnachos were good ~ a bit pricey but it\\'s philly ....\\ni walked in this evening with my two sons. we were told to sit at any table, they were all open. i passed three tables that obviously hadn\\'t been well wiped down to the fourth. as we sat down a waiter came and pulled out my chair for me to see a number of large pieces of food under the table. i was shocked when he didn\\'t seem to mind and we left remarking that the restaurant seemed very dirty. the waiter said nothing just let us leave. wow!\\nif i could give zero stars, i would.  this is the first time i\\'ve left a review for a restaurant but this place was that bad that i feel people  should be forewarned before even considering going here.  we were here on sunday for an early dinner at 5.  we sat outside and there were a few tables taken but they were all settling up their checks and gone in a few minutes of our arrival.  the place was really slow, i think maybe one table was occupied inside the restaurant.  a few minutes after we sat down a waitress came by with water and immediately disappeared before we could order a beer.  unfortunately we were sitting outside for 20 minutes with no sign of anyone coming to the table, no one to get a drink order, nothing!  it was pretty ridiculous, we were sitting outside for 20 minutes at a practically empty restaurant with no sign of anyone that wanted to wait on us.  we decided to just leave and go eat somewhere else, no one even said anything or acknowledged us when we got up and left!  this place is a joke and certainly not how any business should be run.\\nfood is amazing but the service is terrible.  visited this establishment for a second time yesterday for brunch.  place was not very busy.  there were three of us and it took 45 minutes for us to get our food.  it seemed like there was only one waiter working in the entire place.  the waiter came by our table and told us that would meals were being plated - which took 10 minutes.  i ordered the french toast burger and the burger was 100% raw.  i had asked the waiter to send it back.  it took 15 minutes for my burger to come back.  the two other people who were with me were finished their means before i received mine for the second time.  when i looked at the burger, half of it was missing and all of the cream cheese icing had been scraped off.  i told this all to the waiter and he apologized and said he would \"take care of some of it.\"  after receiving the bill i notcied that i was still charged $12 for the burger.  i notified the waiter and he apologized and then removed the charge completely.  \\n\\nit is a shame that service is so slow both times that i went to this restaurant as the food is quite delicious.  not sure if i would go back a third time.\\ngreat beer and great food! two roads jam beer- amazing! great berry flavor, but not too overwhelming. for food we had pickles, asparagus and the buffalo wings. probably top 3 wings i\\'ve ever had. great flavor! went on a thursday night. not very crowded. would def be back!\\nmy boyfriend and i came in for brunch soon after the bsbh opened. i ordered the quinoa salad, which was pretty good, but the portion size was smaller than i expected for a $10 vegetarian salad. however, what made our experience two star was the service. our waiter didn\\'t seem to know the menu, was scattered, and not terribly personable. we attributed the mediocre service to the staff still getting settled, but weren\\'t particularly excited to give it another try.\\n\\nthis past friday, we were looking for a casual place for dinner, and decided to give bsbh another chance. afterall, it\\'s in a great location, and has a serious beer selection, and outdoor seating. our first strange interaction was with the host. we requested a table by the open windows, so we could feel like we were outside, but avoid the impending rain. the host was silent for a good 20 seconds--staring at us, at the table chart, at the tables we asked for. finally, he grabbed menus and we followed him to the section. immediately, we could tell he was going to put us at the table closest to the kitchen and bathroom, despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty. we quickly asked if we could take a different table. this request was met by yet another (extremely awkward) 20 seconds of silence and staring before he put our menus down and allowed us to sit.\\n\\nfinally seated, the waitress came over immediately and asked us for our drink order, clearly before we had a chance to look at the menu. we asked for another minute to read over the extensive beer list. 60 seconds later, she showed back up, asking for our drink and food order. we inquired about specials, to which she replied that she\\'s not used to saying them, because people always read them for themselves on the chalkboard (we had our backs to said board), which made us feel a little stupid.\\n\\nwe ordered the veggie burger and the chicken sandwich. both were edible, but not great. the veggie burger came in a pita, and was probably the size of two standard patties, which was slightly unappetizing. the chicken sandwhich had so much cheese on it, you could barely taste anything else. the best part of the meal was the rejuvenation beer cocktail (hefeweizen, rye, lavender syrup, lemon juice).\\n\\noverall, bsbh is disappointing. we might come back here for a drink, but would definitely sit at the bar.\\nwe were extremely excited to see a new and seemingly chic restaurant opening 2 blocks away from where i live, and decided to patronize the new place last evening (nov 10) for an early dinner. we were pleasantly surprised to be seated quickly, despite the place being busy at that early hour. the hostess and wait staff were welcoming, and all was looking up as we were led to our table. perusing the menu, one can\\'t help but notice the limited menu selection, but i have patronized other restaurants with a comparably limited menu that deliver a great product-unfortunately, \"it\\'s not the case here.\"  beer selection and prices were very good; however, here is the food story.  we ordered micro brew beers, a house cocktail , 2 appetizers (the allegedly home pickled beets with feta and fried mixed root vegetable chips) and 3 main courses (two pulled pork and one fried cod sandwiches.)the beets tasted like the grocery store canned variety, while the chips were more like overly greasy crumbs; both were served before the libations because both the bar and waitstaff were overwhelmed. the main course came next, but a main course label is very debatable. two measly portioned pulled pork sandwiches with about 10-12 small cut fries per plate,  and a thickly breaded 3\" filet of cod on a charred hamburger bun that appeared to be four times the size of the fish with equal amount of fries. we were astonished at the pork portions but outraged over the fish and lack there of. we decided to complain to the waitress. who promptly passed our dissatisfaction to the manager. the manager was genuinely concerned and tried to remedy the situation by bringing out another piece of fish. wanting to eat the food while it had some semblance of warmth left, we reluctantly began eating before the other piece of cod came. the pork was slightly over-vinegared, while the fish greasy and non-existent! to quote my friend \" it tastes as if i\\'m eating a charred bread sandwich.\" anyway, the meal and plates were cleared before an identical and equally smalll piece of fish arrived at the table. tat led us to believe it\\'s the portioned amount for that entree, and definitely not worth the $11:00-$13:00 for their main course meals. in an effort to satisfy us, the manager had 2 complementary desserts sent to us (olive oil cake with salted caramel pistachio ice cream and a crÃ¨me caramel) that were both very good. i feel this place has some potential and welcome any and all improvements they make. until then, i will watch yelp reviews for signs of improvements before going back again.\\ngreat drinks, great location, chill atmosphere-what more can you ask for?\\nhighly recommend!\\nthis is hands down the best happy hour in the city! the staff is always very friendly and make sure to get our drink orders in before happy hour ends (which is a huge plus!). plus, they have a rotating (very large) craft beer list, so you are always choosing new things. we\\'ve only had some of the appetizers for food (wings were great, mac just okay), so this review is more for the happy hour and beer selection. definitely an awesome place if you are looking for a chill happy hour spot with a great selection and friendly staff.\\ni wanted to like this place. the drinks were pretty good, the beer selection was good. the lamb sausage dish with eggs and potato was very good. this restaurant has some consistency issues, however. the chicken for my wife\\'s chicken and waffles was like shoe leather. we couldn\\'t cut it with a knife. when we asked for another piece of chicken we then got a piece that was twice the size and raw in the middle. i ordered the porkenstein which was tasty, but i am almost 100% sure the pork burger is actually turkey because it was so dry and flavorless. a friend ordered a thing advertised as \\'rib eye, eggs and hollandaise sauce\\'. this was basically eggs benedict with scant trimmings of some sort of steak instead of canadian bacon/ham. the muffin was so thin we made jokes about it. it was like 1/4 inch thick. clearly there is a lack of oversight in the kitchen. the final insult was when the server didn\\'t comp our dreadful chicken experience. i hope they get their act together because i like what they are trying to do with the menu, but the reality falls short of the dream.\\nstopped at the barrel house this weekend to get a beer because they had nice outdoor seating and advertised an extensive craft brew list. my friend\\'s beer came out warm, which could not have gone unnoticed by the server because he poured the beer himself at our table... but anyway, they did end up replacing it after reporting that one of the beer reach-ins was not working properly. got charged for the warm beer anyway, so had to have the check fixed. my main issue though with bsbh from one visit is that everything took a long time, even though it wasn\\'t busy at all. the staff was nice enough--but from start to finish, the service was painfully slow. not in a rush here to go back.\\ngreat spot for happy hour! nice happy hour menu, i had $5 margaritas. which for $5 weren\\'t bad at all! we shared the nachos which also were great. the service was good! it wasn\\'t bad but not outstanding!\\nmy girlfriend and i ate here yesterday, 1/27/13, about an hour before brunch was coming to an end.  there was a great bustling crowd in the restaurant, yet we were lucky enough to grab two seats at the bar.  we went there after seeing their tap list on phillytapfinder.com.  i\\'m so glad we went! the tap list was simply amazing. lots of beers that i\\'ve never seen in any bar in philly or the suburbs.  after talking to the nice and welcoming manager, scott, it turns out they just recently had a sour beer event, and some left overs were on tap.  i hope they keep getting in the rare brews!  my girlfriend and i both drank a couple sour ales (local option kentucky bourbon sour & trois dames oude bruin were stand outs!) and we each ordered the sally smothers burger. i had originally wanted the porkenstein sandwhich, but that was \"86\\'d\", which was understandable since they had their busiest brunch service yet.  but the sally smothers burger, with a soft warm bun, juicy, perfectly cooked beef, pancetta, fried-just-right crispy onion straws, and an over easy egg on top,  was an awesome second choice. the decor is beautiful, with an open kitchen, a long bar, lights hanging from the ceiling in mason jars, and a nice overall layout of tables.  it\\'s a great mix of rustic and sleek design.  we can\\'t wait to visit again!  my girlfriend and i loved this place!\\nin short, an excellent atmosphere, terrific brunch menu, likable staff, & extensive beer list.\\n\\nreview:  \\n\\nthis is a newer restaurant/pub in the southwark/queen village area. the interior has low key lighting, with a handsome woody decor. the bar is counter style, but it works with the two big screens on the wall behind it. tables are cozy and close, but there are more private areas, if needed. large windows surround this corner establishment to provide ample natural light and scenery.\\n\\nthe soup of the day may be a traditional staple with a slight twist (like tomato bisque) or something unique (like pork soup with cabbage). the brunch has everything from waffles and pancakes to creative omelets(italian,greek, etc...)  (or the make your own mutt omelet),  there is also the french toast burger - which tastes as good as it sounds. i\\'ve thoroughly enjoyed everything i\\'ve ordered (after four trips) from the menu to date.\\n\\nthe barkeeps are very knowledgeable and friendly, they will offer a sample of a brew on tap, if ,you are curious about something, and they will even take time to make honest and sincere chat with the customers at the bar. the manager seems like a genuinely nice guy as well. this is something you only find in better neighborhood establishments (take it from this pub veteran).\\n\\nthat brings me to the beer list. how does 25 rotating flavors on tap sound? how about a few barrel-aged flavors?  if , your still not sure- no problem, there is a well categorized bottled beer menu (about 8 pages) which will surely have something to your liking. if your thirsty for a beer, this is the place to stop.\\n\\nif , you have yet to visit the bainbridge street barrel house, it is as good as any pub you have ever visited, however, after you enter through the revolving door and settle into your seat, you will soon realize that you made one of the best decisions of your day. this is a warm and unpretentious place, where you may not bump into the world\\'s most interesting man, but, that is only because he has not been there yet.\\nwent today for brunch.  our server, colin, was very pleasant.  \\nmy husband & i were seated near the door.  after seeing we were blasted w/ wind when customers came in, colin locked the door w/ out us having to ask.  \\n\\nthe food was great.  we ordered the chicken w/ biscuit waffle; and pork roll, egg & cheese on a biscuit.  $5 mimosas-- can\\'t go wrong. \\n\\nwe will definitely be back again.\\nwe went out on a thursday night looking for a bite to eat without too much ado. arriving at barrel house we realized it was exactly what we were looking for. it was filled only about a third to half capacity, so it was not too loud. we sat in one of the booths close to the bar, which provided a great view of the games on tv. \\n\\nfor drinks we had two of the boulder mojo risin\\'. it was a double ipa with a very light aroma of grapefruit after taste. it was one of a large selection of craft beers on the menu. \\n\\nwe ordered the often recommended brussel sprouts. they came with a mix of apples, bacon, almonds, and onions. they did not disappoint. i could have had five orders of those and been happy. the lamb sausage was recommended over the duck confit from the waitress. she said the chef likes cooking the sausage better. it was quite tasty, not too spicy and the mustard didn\\'t overwhelm it. it did take a little bit too long to come out, which the server did acknowledge that it was put on after our brussel sprouts had already been finished by us. for an entree i selected the braised short ribs over a sweet potato and broccolini. all of the taste complemented each other well and i was happy with the selection. they do not short you, no pun intended, on the ribs, either.\\n\\noverall i was pleased with the venue, staff, and food. i would recommend it to anyone looking to get a bite without going too upscale, but rather looking for a comfortable place with good food.\\nwent to barrel house on its first friday open. very busy. we did get an awesome table for our large party after waiting not too long. beer list was excellent and the bottle list extensive. service was good considering how busy it was and it being the first week.\\n\\nas for the food, i was most disappointed with the size for the money. the french fry appetizers were tasty but they could have fit many more fries in the serving dishes. or they could have used smaller dishes! the burger was tasty but i didn\\'t understand the double patty especially because it was not covered in cheese. lettuce and tomato would have been great or at least made the plate appear more full. or they could have given more fries! there are many places nearby with more impressive burger plates. hopefully they will improve. also the falafel burger looked more like fried fish than falafel.\\n\\noverall great beers and food that needs some work or at least some super sizing.\\ncame to barrel house for sunday drinks. wasn\\'t going to eat, but artie made the specials sound so delicious that we had to try it. and we were definitely not disappointed. artie was amazing!!!  great drinks and food with incredible service!!\\ni\\'ve been here for brunch and dinner. \\n\\npros:  good beer selection.  excellent decor - very open and airy.  good place to sit by a window on a summer day. \\n\\nfood:  pretty much everything else. brunch was ok - hard to mess up a waffle.  but i went to dinner with another person and both our meals were subpar.  we split a fried calamari appetizer; it was a bit greasy, and small portions.  i had the fried chicken entree, which was a greasy mess.  there was oil pooling on the plate, and the breading was soaked with grease and so soggy it was falling off.  plus i believe they bread chicken thighs instead of breasts or wings, which adds to the fattiness/greasiness.  my gf had the chicken sandwich, which had a very small chicken patty.  she described the sandwich as \"mostly bun.\"  overall, i didn\\'t find the menu selection to be good, but i realize that might be a subjective thing. \\n\\nservice:  as soon as we sat down (coming in after walking on south street for a while on a 90 degree day), the first thing our waitress said was that it was \"against the law\" to bring in outside food and drink and told me i couldn\\'t have my iced coffee at the table, but offered to let me \"finish it outside if [i] want.\"  while i am not an expert in the local regulations, i\\'m pretty sure my waitress could\\'ve allowed me to finish the remaining six ounces of my iced coffee and escape prosecution.  it was pretty weird and standoffish.  i later on ordered a coffee to deal with my caffeine deficit, which she charged me for.  while the food and drinks came pretty quickly (the place was empty), the waitress couldn\\'t give us much guidance on the menu. \\n\\noverall, very disappointing.  this place looked pretty cool, and i\\'d go there for drinks again because of the setup and beer list, but it\\'s one of the few places i have definitively crossed off my list for food.  i realize there is a relative lack of comparable places (i.e. good beer selection, not \"bar food\") in the south street area, but chickies, bistrot le minette and beau monde, right within the immediate vicinity, are much better imo.\\nin hindsight, it probably wasn\\'t the best idea to celebrate my mom\\'s 60th birthday by going here for their first sat. morning brunch.  but the idea of avoiding long lines at morning glory and sabrina\\'s was too enticing.\\n\\nwe were seated promptly as we got there just as they opened.  server was attentive if not a bit overwhelmed.  it became quite comical as we discovered those sitting around us (including us) had something wrong with what we ordered.  i could see a lot of people scratching their heads at omelets that was mostly egg and no substance, undercooked pancakes and sending dishes back since it wasn\\'t what they ordered.  in general the servers were apologetic but there was little remedy to correct mistakes or even taking items off the bill.\\n\\nin particular, the general manager was not at all willing to accept that the kitchen was ill prepared for the tasks at hand.\\n\\ni would like to come back and give them another chance, but likely won\\'t until they work out major kinks and management changes their dismissive attitude.\\ngreat place to eat and have some cocktails. nice variety of ipa\\'s. the food was delicious.\\nfair number of beers on tap, but all i wanted was a simple helles .  service was kinda slow and the place wasn\\'t packed. i won\\'t rush back here, but if the weather is right and i\\'m in the neighborhood, i might give it another try.\\nthe location was great - so nice to sit outside and enjoy a balmy afternoon!\\ni was excited when i read about this place opening in queen village.  i am no longer excited after my experience this evening. terrible food and bad attitudes.\\nbrunch service was appalling. the staff were poorly trained and no manager in sight. we had to keep asking the bus boy to get things for us as the server was preoccupied faffing around folding napkins, plus the place was only half full. the kitchen took over an hour to cook our eggs and the pulled pork eggs benedict looked like someone had spewed on the plate. there are so many better places to brunch in philly, and this ain\\'t one if them.\\ni really want to like this restaurant; it\\'s close to my house and has a great atmosphere, outside seating and good beer selection.  the food is just not good and if you catch it on a busy night the service is no better.\\ni really enjoyed the sour beers draft list. it felt curated, if only because it was themed, but also for the range of choices and deliveries. want something served in a particular type of glass? you can choose based on that silly decision. also abv, origin, price, etc. \\nwe tried a fair collection and i was pretty pleased with the variety and quality of the pours. \\nthe food was okay. there was goat cheese on a lot of it, so i wasn\\'t going to be upset. put goat cheese on a piece of asphalt and i\\'ll probably still eat it. i was not impressed by the fries, but other reviewers were fans. the fried pickles weren\\'t amazing, either. i love fried pickles. these were less than average - a sweeter pickle, batter/breading with no flavor to it, and a texture that wasn\\'t soft or crunchy. the dipping sauce that came with was supposed to be a whiskey aioli - i\\'m not sure why it was supposed to be whiskey flavored in the first place (is whiskey and pickles a thing? for pregnant women?) but it didn\\'t translate. just a slightly tangier mayo. on top of a lackluster pickle, i wish i hadn\\'t bothered.\\nbeing that it was the first week and they are still working out their kinks, service was ok...the food on the other hand needs a lot of work.  to start the portions are very small.  we ordered the fries in mushroom sauce which was very good, however there were like only a skimpy handful of fries.  the table also got an order of the calamari and the pork belly, both portions being a joke for the price!  finally, for dinner i got the lamb gyro which was terrible!  the meat was dry and crumbling apart, there was hardly any sauce, the only redeeming quality was the pita bread...i will not be visiting barrel house again anytime soon, which is a shame being that it is right across the street from me.\\nlove this place.  they have a great beer selection.  went to philly for the weekend a few weeks ago.  we ended friday night at the bainbridge and we liked it so much we went back for brunch on sunday.  the 4 cheese mac is to die for.  also try the mussels and the fresh lamb sausage.  my favorite thing was their signature drink, the bainbridge.  i am a big bourbon drinker and this may be the best bourbon drink i have ever had.   it is sorta like an old fashion but with a sour cherry twist.  can\\'t wait to go back.\\nfirst i want to say..the place is so cute.  they have indoor/outdoor seating, the inside is really nice and comfortable.  i had high hopes.  we went for mother\\'s day, the host was very pleasant, and handed me a rose.  nice.  there\\'s the one star for that.\\n\\nwe sit down and it takes a really long time for anyone to come over to take our drink order.  by the time the waiter does, we are ready to order our meals.  as soon as we are done ordering, a waitress comes over and ask us if we are ready to order.  disorganized, but, i can look past that.  i will say again, i really wanted to like this place.\\n\\nour food comes.  my husband gets a french toast burger, which was a little pricey, not much to it, and he said it was just okay.  i get the french toast which was pretty yummy...and i ordered my 2 year old daughter pancakes.  as i begin to cut her pancakes, i flip one over and notice a hair in the pancakes.  sigh.  i tell the waiter, who says, \"oh yes i see that...\" and takes the plate away.  my daughter proceeds to cry....which was not fun for a mommy on mother\\'s day.  hey, she wanted her pancakes!\\n\\nanyway, it takes a good 10 minutes or so for a new plate to be made.  they are pancakes, come on! and when the waitress returns, she says to us, \"well it wasn\\'t my hair!\"  we did not receive an apology from anyone.  and we were also charged for the pancakes...i think since it was their mistake, and they upset my daughter, they could have done something for us.  or at least an apology.\\n\\nwill not be returning :-(\\ngreat cocktails, house infused spirits, friendly staff. what else could you ask for?\\ngreat beer selection, pretty solid food. plenty of outdoor seating too.  will be back here soon, hopefully for quizzo!\\natmosphere was very cool.  bartender was very knowledgeable about beer & food!  good brunch!  definitely be back to try dinner.  awesome draft & bottle selection.\\ngreat beer, food can be hit or miss. i\\'ve had some good dishes and also some very mediocre food. service is also spotty sometimes but i keep coming back for the excellent draft list.\\nafter the first 2 selection were not available off the food menu on a sunday night because they were sold out. dont really care if the food is good from this point. kitchen needs better management if you cant even stock whats on a small menu. our first time here probably our last. looks like a nice place wish our experience could have been better.\\ni came here after an unusually short day at work. i called up my broinlaw who lives a couple blocks away in society hill to join me. i got there i think at 410 ish? and i think hh started at 430?  some establishments aren\\'t so technical and will give you the hh discount if its close to hh. this place isn\\'t one.. in fact the waiter suggested we come back in 20 minutes if we wanted those prices.  which we weren\\'t going to do for a mere 1-2 dollar break. when we end up ordering a few more beers during the actual hh times they still charged us regular prices. i called them out on it which they corrected eventually. awkward.  overall decent sampling of beers but there are other joints in the neighborhood with better selection for cheaper prices.. regardless if its hh or not ;)\\nmy fav neighborhood spot. food is awesome. but they need to do something about the service. waited more than 30 min for lunch and usually longer for dinner.\\ni was visiting philadelphia for my family reunion. as i took a historical walk through downtown and center city, i realized i was in front of mother bethel ame church, the first organized black church. i had been there friday on a tour. so, i took a photo and continued until i saw a sandwich sign that advertised homemade ice cream and a wide array of bourbons. i strolled in an sat at the bar. i\\'m search of bourbon-infused beer, i tasted some great beers and a delicious grilled watermelon salad. topped with arugula, crab, avocado and diced tomatoes, the warm watermelon was flavourful.  the bartender was very helpful and let me taste different beers until i found the taste i was seeking.  it was the perfect meal for a hot day in philadelphia.  i topped it off with two scoops of homemade green tea and red bean ice cream.\\nthe beer selection is world-class. i don\\'t understand how this place only has three stars.  i\\'ve mostly been here only to drink, so maybe it\\'s the food that\\'s the problem. but the beer selection is outstanding.\\nexcellent beer and paralleled food quality and selection! amazing staff... but i have personal reasons for the bias... so give the place a try and make your own judgement call.  after all, we are a universe of diverse individuals; with which comes different strokes for different folks. so go on in and and decide for yourselves.\\ni live in the neighborhood so i\\'ve given this place a try three different times and i just won\\'t go back anymore.  the food is quite bad. my last visit was for brunch with my husband, son, and daughter-in-law.  the scrambled eggs and omelet were swimming in grease and the breakfast meat was fatty and undercooked. three out of four of us didn\\'t eat their meal so we went home and i cooked breakfast.  dinner on two previous occasions was not as gross but the food was lousy.  it seems that their cooks just don\\'t know how to cook good food. the service was fine - neither great nor terrible.\\nbest chicken and waffles bruch special ever!!! great brunch food all around and fun atmosphere. love the board game selection too.\\ni come here a lot, it\\'s all of three blocks from my house. i really do enjoy the food. the sally smothers is one of the best burgers around and their beer list is really good. i bring my two three year olds with me often and they have always been willing to make something off menu for them (grilled cheese, chicken strips.)\\n\\nbut let\\'s be honest, the service sucks. i don\\'t understand how they still don\\'t have enough people on staff and they cover tables scattered throughout the entire place and not sections.\\n\\nit shouldn\\'t take ten minutes for my waitress to come back with the news that the beer list hasn\\'t been updated and they are out of what i want. and then another ten to get my next choice. \\n\\ni want to like this place more and i\\'ll still go there often, but i fully expect to wait awhile when i go.\\nthe least enjoyable meal i have had in a long time. 3rd strike - even really good beer is not a reason to go back again.\\nhad brunch here, sat outside. the waitstaff is extremely helpful and attentive. food was pretty good however they were out of the pulled pork that i wanted (must mean its great). food took a bit long to come out but once it did they kept checking in on us. \\n\\nbrunch was inexpensive, would definitely go again.\\ntldr: dead bug in the pretzels, not discounted or comped, overcharged for our other food, and probably lied to about the presence of a manager \"in the back\".\\n\\nwent here for a quick happy hour on a tuesday evening. evan was our server (and maybe the agm?). husband and i each had a beer and an app. he had the kebab and i had the pretzel bites. everything was going fine until i got to the bottom of the pretzels, lifted the last one, and found a dead mosquito in the bowl underneath. i told the waiter it wasn\\'t a big deal and he didn\\'t need to comp it because i just didn\\'t eat the only pretzel that touched it. he said he\\'d go speak to a manager, then came back and silently dropped off a face-down check 5 minutes later. the check had the pretzels at full price and the kebab actually double the happy hour price (we had ordered directly in the middle of happy hour, and there was no dispute it should be happy hour price). now, like i said, i wasn\\'t asking for anything free. but i mean, evan never even offered any remedy at any point and charged full price with no discussion, which felt presumptuous. then when we brought the overpriced kebab to his attention, he took the bill, took most but not all of the extra total off, telling us he had put his own money in the register. which is super sketchy. he said his manager wouldn\\'t let him correct the price. we asked to speak to the manager. he said ok and disappeared for a few minutes. came back and told us the manager was occupied in the back with \"health inspection related duties\" but he had managed to fully correct the price this time magically. we could clearly see into the kitchen and there was only one person back there- the cook. so we paid full price for pretzels with a bug in them and finally the correct price for our other food and got the hell out. we left our number and email on a comment card and evan said they\\'d contact us to make it right with coupons but nothing as of yet... never going back. totally skeeved out by the dishonesty mostly.\\nnicely tucked away from the heavy traffic of south street the barrel house has got some solid goods. having been here for dinner several times, the rotation of specialty burgers and sandwiches are excellent as well as other seasonal dishes. the beer list has depth and getting there for happy hour ensures you can get several quality craft beers in for 5$ each. when the weathers warm they open up out door seating while maintaining prompt service.\\ntheir vegan hash is terrible. the tempeh and tofu  was unseasoned and was just dumped in broth. i really regret eating here.\\nthe food is out of this world!!! it\\'s the perfect neighborhood bar in queens village! staff is super friendly and attentive! they have to have at least 20 craft beers on draft and they make really tasty cocktails! the barrel house also has an amazing happy hour... and don\\'t even get me started about their sunday brunch! $5 bloody mary\\'s and mimosas!!! totally recommend checking out! especially for beer week!\\natmosphere ,staff and beer selection very good.  food is kinda so so.  would def give it another try.\\nfirst impressions are everything! my mom and i stopped by bainbridge with every intention of getting a snack and a drink, but we needed to use the restroom first. we were immediately approached by a waiter that stopped us and told us that the bathroom was for customers only. while i understand the policy, he could have very well approached us differently... or they could have a sign on their doors. the way he did it was actually sort of creepy as we were sort of cornered into the hall. we told the waiter we had every intention on grabbing a drink and he let us go. we went back out to the dining area after to wait to be greeted, but no one came to us. annoyed, we just decided to leave. as we left, the same waiter came to the door and very snarky, said \"thanks for coming in\" ... well, thanks for showing us your true colors bainbridge, because with creepers like him, we will not ever go back!\\nthe restaurant served up some good eats and drinks! the fried rice with the tofu was delicious!!! i truly enjoyed the spicy ness of the dish! the management/owner was very accommodating. if in the are i would definitely stop in!\\nfinding this gem was truly amazing. after walking up south st. we turned on sixth and stumbled onto the barrel house. the owner came out to personally accommodate my gluten free friend. the craft beer selection was very extensive including both bottle and draft. the food is a good mix of tavern style and classy bistro. we ate and drank outside on their sidewalk seating enjoying the quiet noises of bainbridge street.\\ndisappointing to say the least! such a shame that this is on our doorstep the space has so much potential but unfortunately the fetfazes family have no idea how to use it. \\nthe food is overpriced and took forever to reach our table,  also don\\'t make any special requests as \"chef eric \" does not seem to like it  (remember you have an open kitchen and your customers can see your reaction !) when the food arrived it was bland , over cooked and just like the other reviews said comparable to applebee\\'s ! the service was ok, despite the servers looking miserable and obviously counting down till home time! all in all save your money and stroll around the corner to growlers everything the barrel house wishes it could be!\\ni just moved to philadelphia from santa monica today and this was my first night out  in the city of brotherly love. let me tell you, unless you are just drinking, do not ever come here, ever... \\n\\nliterally the worst dining experience of my life. i wish i could identify a specific problem but unfortunately there were many.\\none star for outside seating. otherwise, worst dining experience ever! we waited over 1.5 hrs for our food - two salads, a veggie burger and a chicken sandwich - nothing complicated - and that was after complaining a couple of times to the manager, who was pleasantly ineffectual. after the first hour, we explained that we were very hungry (it was after 9pm & none of us had eaten since lunch) & asked for the bread they\\'d offered when they took our order. it took two more reminders to get it. my friend pulled a luna bar out of her purse and we nibbled on that while we waited. \\n the manager called the owner who sanctioned a 50% discount - at that point, it should\\'ve been on the house. and they had the gall to charge a dollar for the bread! \\nstay away from this place unless you just wanna sit outside and drink. go ahead, get really sloshed but bring your own food.\\nsheesh where do i start with this place. visually it\\'s a very relaxed and comfy decor. amazingly friendly and knowledgeable staff. the sally smothers and yo! adrian burger could easily take the place of the top 2 and 3 burgers in the city right right behind the award winning barrel house burger already ranked at number 1. the whisky selection is easily one of the best in the city alongside their amazing variety of drafts built to fit any pallet. don\\'t get me started on the brunch menu. do yourself a favor and set aside a few days to try everything on the menu. guaranteed you\\'ll find a new favorite every time you go!\\ngreat building, friendly staff and awesome location.  owner is always friendly and recommends the best food.  i\\'m super stuffed, fat and happy!\\nlooking for a good brunch/lunch place we hadn\\'t tried yet on our many trips to philly. walked about 2 miles from our hotel to get here but it was totally worth it! good beer selection with solid suggestions from our bartender river who was moving the entire time we we sat at the bar. this place has totally been added to our post race philly rotation!\\nhands down, one of the best restaurants in philly. the food is outstanding, with the ingredients being locally sourced and even home grown produce! the extensive beer list provides a great variety for all of the beer fanatics! and the staff are extremely attentive and on point with every order. i highly recommend you take the time to truly enjoy this finer point of philly!\\nthey couldn\\'t put each couples bill on two separate tickets. they told us they were out of popcorn then i saw it delivered to another table. i asked her about it and she said we have it now. when she brought the popcorn it had a weird seasoning. she said she\\'d take it off our bill then she didn\\'t.\\nthis is the 2nd time i\\'ve given this place a chance because the food is actually pretty good, but the experience is sadly just not worth it. its fine dining without the fine. \\n\\nour recent visit clocked in at 3 hours for a round of drinks and dinner. it wasn\\'t a busy night, but somehow drinks took a good 30mins to arrive, but it was nice out so we still went for it and ordered dinner. mistake. as the night got colder the server turned on another table\\'s heat lamp, but didn\\'t offer to turn ours on- so we sat in the cold, without a drink or food for another 30 mins until i decided to climb the table and turn on the heat lamp myself (servers watched on). after about another 30 the server came by to take another drink order and a mild apology for the wait. it took another 30 for a full apology. finally our food arrive 2.5 hours into the ordeal. mine was a cold plate so i was absolutely floored at the wait. \\n\\nnote to management. 1. it felt like there was absolutely no management happening 2. if people do have the courtesy to sit in the cold for 2.5 hours maybe offer a drink or a fee app or something. i\\'m disappointed to cross this spot off of my list, but 2 strikes and you are out.\\nsuper depressing. took over an hour to get a beer and never got my food. then random beers show up like 1.5 hours later. not that busy but apparently super slammed.\\nstopped here for some good whiskey and grub after a long drive. they had an amazing selection of bourbon and single malt whiskeys for a reasonable price. from blanton\\'s, basil hayden, knob creek to oban 14, and some great islay, speyside whiskey. i had the yo adrian which was a heart attack on plate and was delicious. this spot is not just a whiskey bar, they had an impressive selection of beer, craft, imported or domestic. the manager came out to check on us and ensure we had a good time. the waitress alice was simply  great. can\\'t recommend this place enough.')\n"
